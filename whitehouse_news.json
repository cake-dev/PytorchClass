Trump signed an Executive Order entitled Declassification of Records Concerning the Assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr.\nThe Executive Order establishes the policy that, more than 50 years after these assassinations, the victims’ families and the American people deserve the truth.\nSpecifically, the Order directs the Director of National Intelligence and other appropriate officials to:\n(1) Present a plan within 15 days for the full and complete release of all John F.

Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. assassinations and present a plan for their full and complete release within 45 days.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP IS ENDING THE ENDLESS DELAYS: In his first term, President Trump ordered agencies to move toward disclosing more information about the John F. Kennedy assassination, and now he is ordering that the work be completed.\nThe President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 required all records related to the assassination be released in 25 years, absent a presidential certification that:\nContinued postponement is necessary due to an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations; and\nSuch identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\nIn October 2017 and April 2018 certifications, President Trump directed agencies to reevaluate redactions and disclose any information that no longer warranted withholding.\nPresident Biden delayed disclosure in 2021, 2022, and 2023.\nIn this Order, President Trump finds that continued withholding of the John F.

  "PRESIDENT’S COUNCIL OF ADVISORS ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY": {
    "text": "Presidential Actions\nPRESIDENT’S COUNCIL OF ADVISORS ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\nJanuary 23, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish an advisory council on science and technology, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1.  Purpose.\nThe American story is one of boundless creativity and bold ambition, driven by an indomitable pioneering spirit that propels exploration and discovery.  It is this spirit that illuminated the world with Edison’s lightbulb, carried the Wright brothers into the skies, and sent Armstrong to the moon.  Today, a new frontier of scientific discovery lies before us, defined by transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced biotechnology.  Breakthroughs in these fields have the potential to reshape the global balance of power, spark entirely new industries, and revolutionize the way we live and work.  As our global competitors race to exploit these technologies, it is a national security imperative for the United States to achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance.  To secure our future, we must harness the full power of American innovation by empowering entrepreneurs, unleashing private-sector creativity, and reinvigorating our research institutions.\nAt the heart of scientific progress lies the pursuit of truth.  But this foundational principle, which has driven every major breakthrough in our history, is increasingly under threat. Today, across science, medicine, and technology, ideological dogmas have surfaced that elevate group identity above individual achievement, enforce conformity at the expense of innovative ideas, and inject politics into the heart of the scientific method.  These agendas have not only distorted truth but have eroded public trust, undermined the integrity of research, stifled innovation, and weakened America’s competitive edge.\nThis order establishes the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to unite the brightest minds from academia, industry, and government to guide our Nation through this critical moment by charting a path forward for American leadership in science and technology.\nSec. 2.  Establishment.\n(a)  There is hereby established the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).\n(b)  The PCAST shall be composed of not more than 24 members.  The Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST) and the Special Advisor for AI & Crypto shall be members of the PCAST.  If also serving as the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the APST may designate the U.S. Chief Technology Officer as a member.  The remaining members shall be distinguished individuals and representatives from sectors outside of the Federal Government appointed by the President.  These non-Federal members shall have diverse perspectives and expertise in science, technology, education, and innovation.\n(c)  The APST and the Special Advisor for AI & Crypto shall serve as Co-Chairs of the PCAST.  The Co-Chairs may designate up to two Vice Chairs of the PCAST from among the non-Federal members of the PCAST, to support the Co-Chairs in the leadership and organization of the PCAST.\nSec. 3.  Functions.\n(a)  The PCAST shall advise the President on matters involving science, technology, education, and innovation policy.  The Council shall also provide the President with scientific and technical information that is needed to inform public policy relating to the American economy, the American worker, national and homeland security, and other topics.\n(b)  The PCAST shall meet regularly and shall:\n(i)    respond to requests from the President or the Co-Chairs for information, analysis, evaluation, or advice;\n(ii)   solicit information and ideas from a broad range of stakeholders, including the research community; the private sector; universities; national laboratories; State, local, and Tribal governments; foundations; and nonprofit organizations;\n(iii)  serve as the advisory committee identified in section 101(b) of the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-194), as amended (15 U.S.C. 5511(b)), in which capacity the PCAST shall be known as the President’s Innovation and Technology Advisory Committee; and\n(iv)    serve as the advisory panel identified in section 4 of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act (Public Law 108-153), as amended (15 U.S.C. 7503), in which capacity the PCAST shall be known as the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel.\n(c)  The PCAST shall provide advice from the non-Federal sector to the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) in response to requests from the NSTC.\nSec. 4.  Administration.\n(a)  The heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the PCAST with information concerning scientific and technological matters when requested by the PCAST Co-Chairs and as required for the purpose of carrying out the PCAST’s functions.\n(b)  In consultation with the Co-Chairs, the PCAST is authorized to create standing subcommittees and ad hoc groups, including technical advisory groups, to assist the PCAST and provide preliminary information directly to the PCAST.\n(c)  In order to allow the PCAST to provide advice and analysis regarding classified matters, the Co-Chairs may request that members of the PCAST, its standing subcommittees, or ad hoc groups who do not hold a current clearance for access to classified information receive security clearance and access determinations pursuant to Executive Order 12968 of August 2, 1995 (Access to Classified Information), as amended, or any successor order.\n(d)  The Department of Energy shall provide such funding and administrative and technical support as the PCAST may require, to the extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing appropriations.\n(e)  Members of the PCAST shall serve without any compensation for their work on the PCAST, but may receive travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the government service (5 U.S.C. 5701–5707).\n(f)  Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), may apply to the PCAST, any functions of the President under that Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary of Energy, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the Administrator of General Services.\nSec. 5.  Termination.\nThe PCAST shall terminate 2 years from the date of this order unless extended by the President.\nSec. 6.  Revocation.\nExecutive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology), as amended by Executive Order 14109 of September 29, 2023 (Continuance of Certain Federal Advisory Committees and Amendments to Other Executive Orders), is hereby revoked.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions\n.\n(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\nJanuary 23, 2025.",

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 23, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1.  Policy and Purpose.  More than 50 years after the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Federal Government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events.  Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth.  It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay.\nThe President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 required all records related to the assassination of President Kennedy to be publicly disclosed in full by October 26, 2017, unless the President certifies that:  (i) continued postponement is made necessary by an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations; and (ii) the identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.  President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, section 5(g)(2)(D), Public Law 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443, 3448–49, codified at 44 U.S.C. 2107 note.\nI previously accepted proposed redactions from executive departments and agencies (agencies) in 2017 and 2018, but ordered the continued re-evaluation of those remaining redactions.  See Temporary Certification for Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 82 Fed. Reg. 50,307–08 (Oct. 31, 2017); Certification for Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 83 Fed. Reg. 19, 157–58 (Apr. 26, 2018).  In the Presidential Memorandum of April 26, 2018, I also ordered agencies to re-review each of those redactions over the next 3 years and disclose information that no longer warrants continued withholding under the standard set forth in section 5(g)(2)(D) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.\nPresident Biden issued subsequent certifications with respect to these records in 2021, 2022, and 2023, which gave agencies additional time to review the records and withhold information from public disclosure.  See Temporary Certification Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 86 Fed. Reg. 59,599 (Oct. 22, 2021); Certifications Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 87 Fed. Reg. 77,967 (Dec. 15, 2022); Certification Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 88 Fed. Reg. 43,247 (June 30, 2023).\nI have now determined that the continued redaction and withholding of information from records pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is not consistent with the public interest and the release of these records is long overdue.  And although no Act of Congress directs the release of information pertaining to the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I have determined that the release of all records in the Federal Government’s possession pertaining to each of those assassinations is also in the public interest.\nSec. 2.  Declassification and Disclosure.\n(a)  Within 15 days of the date of this order, the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General shall, in coordination with the\nAssistant to the President for\nNational Security Affairs and the Counsel to the President, present a plan to the President for the full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n(b)  Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General shall, in coordination with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Counsel to the President, review records related to the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and present a plan to the President for the full and complete release of these records.\nSec. 3.  General Provisions.\n(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 23, 2025.",

  "REMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM": {
    "text": "Remarks\nREMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP\nAT THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM\nJanuary 23, 2025\nREMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM\nVia Teleconference\n11:06 A.M. EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, Klaus.  And hello to everyone in beautiful Davos.\nThis has been a truly historic week in the United States.  Three days ago, I took the oath of office, and we began the golden age of America.  The recent presidential election was won by millions of votes and all seven — every one of them — all seven swing states.  It was a massive mandate from the American people like hasn’t been seen in many years.  And some of the political pundits, even some of my so-called enemies, said it was the most consequential election victory in 129 years.  That’s quite nice.\nWhat the world has witnessed in the past 72 hours is nothing less than a revolution of common sense.  Our country will soon be stronger, wealthier, and more united than ever before, and the entire planet will be more peaceful and prosperous as a result of this incredible momentum and what we’re doing and going to do.\nMy administration is acting with unprecedented speed to fix the disasters we’ve inherited from a totally inept group of people and to solve every single crisis facing our country.\nThis begins with confronting the economic chaos caused by the failed policies of the last administration.  Over the past four years, our government racked up $8 trillion in wasteful deficit spending and inflicted nation-wrecking energy restrictions, crippling regulations, and hidden taxes like never before.  The result is the worst inflation crisis in modern history and sky-high interest rates for our citizens and even throughout the world.  Food prices and the price of almost every other thing known to mankind went through the roof.\nPresident Biden totally lost control of what was going on in our country but, in particular, with our high-inflation economy and at our border.  Because of these ruinous policies, total government spending this year is $1.5 trillion higher than was projected to occur when I left office just four years ago.  Likewise, the cost of servicing the debt is more than 230 percent higher than was projected in 2020.\nThe inflation rate we are inheriting remains 50 percent higher than the historic target.  It was the highest inflation probably in the history of our country.  That’s why, from the moment I took office, I’ve taken rapid action to reverse each and every one of these radical left policies that created this calamity — in particular, with immigration, crime, and inflation.\nOn day one, I signed an executive order directing every member of my Cabinet to marshal all powers at their disposal to defeat inflation and reduce the cost of daily life.  I imposed a federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze, a foreign aid freeze, and I created the new Department of Government Efficiency.\nI terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful Green New Deal — I call it the “Green New Scam”; withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord; and ended the insane and costly electric vehicle mandate.  We’re going to let people buy the car they want to buy.\nI declared a national em- — energy emergency — and it’s so important — national energy emergency to unlock the liquid gold under our feet and pave the way for rapid approvals of new energy infrastructure.  The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we’re going to use it.\nNot only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services, it will make the United States a manufacturing superpower and the world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto.\nMy administration has also begun the largest deregulation campaign in history, far exceeding even the record-setting efforts of my last term.\nIn total, the Biden administration imposed $50,000 in additional regulatory costs on the average American household over the last four years.  I have promised to eliminate 10 old regulations for every new regulation, which will soon put many thousands of dollars back in the pockets of American families.\nTo further unleash our economy, our majorities in the House and Senate — which we also took, along with the presidency — are going to pass the largest tax cut in American history, including massive tax cuts for workers and family and big tax cuts for domestic producers and manufacturers.  And we’re working with the Democrats on getting an extension of the original Trump tax cuts, as you probably know by just reading any paper.\nMy message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth.  We’re bringing them down very substantially, even from the original Trump tax cuts.  But if you don’t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff — which will direct hundreds of billions of dollars and even trillions of dollars into our Treasury to strengthen our economy and pay down debt.\nUnder the Trump administration, there will be no better place on Earth to create jobs, build factories, or grow a company than right here in the good old USA.\nAlready, American’s economic — and you can see this, I think, maybe even in your — in your wonderful, wonderful room that you’re all gathered together — so many of my friends — but, Americans, the economic confidence is soaring like we haven’t seen in many, many decades, maybe not at all.\nUpon my election, it was just announced that small-business optimism skyrocketed by 41 points in a single month.  That’s the highest ever.  There’s never been anything like that.\nSoftBank has announced between a $100 and $200 billion investment in the U.S. economy because of the election result.  And just two days ago, Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI announced a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure.  Other companies, likewise, have announced billions and billions and billions — adding up to trillions — of investment in America, in the United States.\nAnd it’s also reported today in the papers that Saudi Arabia will be investing at least $600 billion in America.  But I’ll be asking the crown prince, who’s a fantastic guy, to round it out to around $1 trillion.  I think they’ll do that because we’ve been very good to them.  And I’m also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil.  You got to bring it down, which, frankly, I’m surprised they didn’t do before the election.  That didn’t show a lot of love by them not doing it.  I was a little surprised by that.\nIf the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately.  Right now, the price is high enough that that war will continue.  You got to bring down the oil price; you’re going to end that war.  They should have done it long ago.  They’re very responsible, actually, to a certain extent, for what’s taking place — millions of lives are being lost.\nWith oil prices going down, I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately.  And, likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.  Interest rates should follow us.\nAll over, the progress that you’re seeing is happening because of our historic victory in a recent presidential election, one that has become quite well known throughout the world.\nI think a lot of things are happening to a lot of countries.  They say that there’s light shining all over the world since the election.  And even countries that we aren’t particularly friendly with are happy because they understand what — there is a future and th- — how great the future will be.\nUnder our leadership, America is back and open for business.  And this week, I’m also taking swift action to stop the invasion at our southern border.  They allowed people to come in at levels that nobody has ever seen before.  It was ridiculous.  I decided a — and declared to dec- — to — to do — and very, very importantly — a national emergency on our border; immediately halted all entry of illegal border crossers, of which there were many; and began properly returning the illegal trespassers back to the place from which they came.\nThat action, as you’ve probably seen, has already started very strongly.  I have deployed active-duty U.S. military and National Guard troops to the border to assist in repelling the invasion.  It was really an invasion.  We will not allow our territory to be violated.\nAfter four long years, the United States is strong and sovereign and a beautiful nation once again. It’s a strong, sovereign nation.\nIn addition, I’m pleased to report that America is also a free nation once again.  On day one, I signed an executive order to stop all government censorship.  No longer will our government label the speech of our own citizens as misinformation or disinformation, which are the favorite words of censors and those who wish to stop the free exchange of ideas and, frankly, progress.  We have saved free speech in America, and we’ve saved it strongly.\nWith another historic executive order this week, I also ended the weaponization of law enforcement against the American people — and, frankly, against politicians — and restored the fair, equal, and impartial rule of law.\nMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense — and these are policies that were absolute nonsense — throughout the government and the private sector.  With the recent, yet somewhat unexpected, great Supreme Court decision just made, America will once again become a merit-based country.  You have to hear that word: merit-based country.\nAnd I’ve made it official — an official policy of the United States that there are only two genders, male and female, and we will have no men participating in women’s sports, and transgender operations, which became the rage, will occur very rarely.\nFinally, as we restore common sense in America, we’re moving quickly to bring back strength and peace and stability abroad.  I’m also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to 5 percent of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago — it was only at 2 percent, and most nations didn’t pay until I came along; I insisted that they pay, and they did — because the United States was really paying the difference at that time, and it’s — it was unfair to the United States.  But many, many things have been unfair for many years to the United States.\nBefore even taking office, my team negotiated a ceasefire agreement in the Middle East, which wouldn’t have happened without us, as I think most of the people in the room know.  Earlier this week, the hostages began to return to their families.  They are returning, and it’s a beautiful sight.  And they’ll be coming in more and more.  They started coming back on Sunday.\nOur efforts to secure a peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine are now, hopefully, underway.  It’s so important to get that done.  That is an absolute killing field.\nMillions of soldiers are being killed.  Nobody has seen anything like it since World War II.  They’re laying dead all over the flat fields.  It’s a flat field — farmland, and there’s millions of Russians and millions of Ukrainians.  Nobody’s seen anything like it since World War II.  It’s time to end it.\nAnd here in America, we have big events coming up.  Next year we have the 250th anniversary of America’s founding.  I’m so honored to be president during that.  That’s been a big event.  They’ve been talking about it for 10 years.  We also have the World Cup, and I understand Gianni — Gianni is in the room — Infantino.  He was very instrumental in helping us get it — he’s there with you someplace, I think — and I want to thank him for that.\nAnd then we have the Olympics coming up, which I was instrumental in getting, also, in my first term.  And who would have known that by skipping a term, I would get the Olympics?  I was upset.  I said, “You know, I got the Olympics to come and I won’t be president.”  But it turned out, through a stroke of luck or whatever you might call it, that I’m going to be president during the World Cup and the Olympics and the 250th\nanniversary.  So, that’s going to be three big events.\nAnd we’ve accomplished more in less than four days — we have really been working — four days — than other administrations have accomplished in four years, and we’re just getting started.  It’s really an amazing thing to see, and the spirit and the light over our country has been incredible.\nUnder the last administration, our nation has suffered greatly, but we are going to bring it back and make it greater, bigger, stronger, better than ever before.\nI want to thank everybody for being with you.  I would have been there myself, except the inauguration was two days ago.  I thought it might be a little bit quick to make it the first stop, but we’ll get there one day.  We hope to get there.\nBut I — I do appreciate — I heard the audience is fantastic, and many of my friends are in the audience.  And I will be taking questions now from some very distinguished people.\nThank you all very much.  (Applause.)\nMR. BRENDE:  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr.  President, for that very powerful speech, and I think you could hear the applause all the way from Davos to the White House.  But next year, it will be even better, because then you can get the applause here in Davos.  So, we wish you welcome to our village next year.  We hope to see you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.\nMR. BRENDE:  So, we also know, Mr. President, that you open up for interaction here.  We have a great panel with some of the most distinguished businesspeople in the world.\nLet me start with someone that you know really well, that I think is almost a neighbor of you in Mal-a- — in — in Florida, Mr. Steve Schwarzman, chairman, CEO, and cofounder of Blackstone Group.\nSo, Steve, floor is yours.\nMR. SCHWARZMAN:  Well, Mr. President —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Steve.\nMR. SCHWARZMAN:  — I’m sure the crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I hope so.\nMR. SCHWARZMAN:  You’ve had the busiest four days that anybody can imagine, and congratulations for that.\nAnd my question is — is about some of the things I’ve observed here at Davos.  It’s a terrific forum.  I’ve met lots of people, as usual.  I think I’ve been here 30 years.  And a lot of the European businesspeople have expressed enormous frustration with the regulatory regime in the EU, and they attribute slower growth rates here because of numerous factors, but especially because of regulations.\nAnd you’ve taken a completely different approach in this area.  And if you could explain the theory of what you’re doing, how you’re going to do it, and what you expect the outcome to be, I’d appreciate it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And congratulations, Steve — you’re a friend of mine — but on a great career.  You have had an amazing career and continues.  So, I just want to congratulate you.  Very inspirational to a lot of people.\nI want to talk about the EU, because you mentioned specifically that I’ve also had a lot of friends and leaders of countries.  I’ve gotten to know them all my first term and a little bit during this period of four years and know them well, like them a lot, but they’re very frustrated because of the time everything seems to take to get approved — environmental impact statements for things that you shouldn’t even have to do that, and many, many other ways that it takes.\nAnd I’m going to give you a quick little example.  I w- — in the private life, my beautiful private life — before I had all these things happening — the world is a little different — I had a nice, simple life.  You knew that.\nBut when I had that simple life, I did projects, and I had a big project in Ireland, and it had to get approval on something that would have made it even better.  And I got the approval from Ireland in a period of a week, and it was a very, very, very efficient, good approval.\nAnd they informed me, though, “The problem is you’re going to have to get it from the EU, and we think that’ll take five to six years.”  And I said, “You have to be kidding.”  And this was before politics.  And I said, “Wait a minute.  It’s not that important.  I don’t want to go five or six years.”  But it would have been a big investment.  It would have been nice, and it would have been good for the project.\nAnd I sent the people to the EU to see if they could speed it up, and basically it was a five- or six-year wait just to get a simple approval that Ireland gave me in a period of, literally, not much more than a week.\nAnd I realized right then — that was the first time I really was involved with the EU, but I realized right then, that’s a problem, and I didn’t even bother applying to do it, and — or if I did, I pulled it very quickly.  I don’t wa- — I have to be very accurate, because I don’t want to be criticized.  “He did apply, actually.”  No, I want to be very accurate.  So, I don’t think I did, but if I did, I pulled it very quickly.  It was just something you — you couldn’t wait five years or six years to get an approval.\nSo, a lot of — in a very big business sense, a lot of people are — are claiming that’s the problem.\nFrom the standpoint of America, the EU treats us very, very unfairly, very badly.  They have a large tax that we know about and — a VAT tax — and it’s a very substantial one.  They don’t take our far- — essentially, don’t take our farm products and they don’t take our cars.  Yet, they send cars to us by the millions.\nThey put tariffs on things that we want to do, like, for instance, I think they actually — in terms of these are noneconomic or nonmonetary tariffs, and — and those are very bad, and they make it very difficult to bring products into Europe, and yet they expect to be selling and they do sell their products in the United States.\nSo, we have, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of deficits with the EU, and nobody is happy with it.  And we’re going to do something about it, but nobody is happy with it.  So, I think the EU has to speed up their process.\nFriends of mine that are in some of the nations within the EU, great people, they — they want to be able to compete better, and you can’t compete when you can’t get — go through the approval process fast.  There’s no reason why it can’t go faster.\nSo, you know, I’m — I’m trying to be constructive, because I love Europe.  I love the countries of Europe.  But the process is a very cumbersome one, and th- — and they do treat the United States of America very, very unfairly with the VAT taxes and all of the other taxes they impose.\nOne other — just to finish up, I got a call from the head of a major airline, one of the biggest airlines in the world.  And he said, “Sir, could you help us?”  “What?” “Landing in Europe is brutal.  They charge us fees for everything, and it’s so unfair.”  I said, “How does it compare to China?”  He said, “It’s — it’s much worse.”\nAnd the other thing, as you know, they took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn’t think was much of a case.  They won $15 or $16 billion from Apple.  They won billions from Google.  I think they’re after Facebook for billions and billions.\nThese are American companies.  Whether you like them or not, they’re — they’re American companies, and they shouldn’t be doing that.  And that’s — as far as I’m concerned, it’s a form of taxation.\nSo, we have some very big complaints with the EU.\nThank you.\nMR. BRENDE:  Tha- — thank you very much, Mr. President.  We’ll now go to one of your friends in the EU, Patrick Pouyanné.  He’s the chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.\nI guess you have a question ready, Patrick, for the president.\nMR. POUYANNÉ:  Mr. President, as we understand, energy is at the top of your agenda, and it’s an honor for me to represent the energy industry tonight in this panel.  TotalEnergies is indeed the fourth largest oil and gas and electricity company in the world.\nI will not ask you a question about the oil price.  It’s quite clear what you expect from us.  I will more go to gas more.  And we, our company, is the largest, number one exporter LNG from the U.S. company.  We are a strong contributor to and we invest in mammoth LNG projects in Texas, $20 billion.  It’s far from $200, but it’s $20 billion.  And we contribute with that to security of supply to Europe as we export this LNG to Europe.\nSome experts fear that if there are too many projects developed in the U.S. on LNG, this could have an inflat- — inflationary impact on the U.S. domestic gas price, and they recommend a pause on these projects.\nI would ask you the following question: What are your views on — about such a pause on investments on LNG in the U.S.?  What would happen if you would observe an increased domestic gas price because of these exports?  And final question, which is important for Europe: Would you agree to guarantee security of supplies of U.S. LNG to Europe?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, on the last part of your question, yes, I would.  I would make sure that you get it.  If we make a deal, we make a deal; you’ll get it.  Because a lot of people do have that problem.  They make a deal, and then it can’t get supplied because of war-type problems and other problems.  So, we would absolutely do that.\nLNG is very interesting, because when I took office for the first term, one of the first things I looked at was two — there were two very massive plants in Louisiana, a state that has been very good to me.  I won it by many, many points, and\nI felt strongly indebted to it, actually.\nAnd they said there are two plants that have been under environmental consideration for more than 10 years, and they were costing — as you say, you know how expensive those plants are — but they were costing like $12 billion and, I think, $14 or $15 billion.  But they couldn’t get their permits.  It was — they were in review for years — many, many years — like a decade or more.\nAnd I said, “So ridiculous.”  I know so much about that, because in the construction industry, I had to go through it too, but I got good at it after a while.\nBut I — I went — I saw the projects, and you’re talking about a total investment of $25 to $30 billion, and it looked like it was going to end.  They couldn’t get their permits, and I got them done in less than a week.  It was done, completed.\nIn fact, when they called them to announce that it was done, the countries — largely countries — Japan was involved and — and another country and some very big investors — they couldn’t believe it.  They actually couldn’t believe it.\nAnd I said, “Just do yourself one favor.  Don’t pay any consultants, because the only one that got it done was me.”  I got it done because it was the right thing to do for the U.S. and for the world, but the consultants had nothing to do with it, you know?  The consultants go in and they say, “Give us millions of dollars because Trump did it.”  Nobody called me about it.  I just heard it was a problem for years, and I got it done because it was the right thing to do for the U.S. and the right thing to do for beyond.  It had to do with energy — very important.\nSo, I think it’s very important.  I think the — the — you know, I disagree with one.  I think the more that you do, the lower the price is going to go.  And what I’d like to see is rapid approvals.\nWe’re going to give very rapid approvals in the United States, like with the AI plants, talking to — many people want to build them.  That’s going to be a very big thing.\nWe’re going to build electric generating facilities — they are going to build.  I’m going to get them the approval.  Under emergency declaration, I can get the approvals done myself without having to go through years of waiting.\nAnd the big problem is we need double the energy we currently have in the United States — can you imagine? — for AI to really be as big as we want to have it.  Because it’s a very competitive — it will be very competitive with China and others.\nSo, I’m going to give emergency declarations so that they can start building them almost immediately.\nAnd I’m — I’m — I think it was largely my idea, because nobody thought this was possible.  It wasn’t that they were not smart, because they’re the smartest, but I told them that what I want you to do is build your electric generating plant right next to your plant as a separate building, connected.  And they said, “Wow, you’re kidding.”  And I said, “No, no.  I’m not kidding.”  You don’t have to hook into the grid, which is old and, you know, could be taken out.  If it’s taken out, they wouldn’t have any way to get any electricity.\nSo, we are going to allow them to go on a very rapid bas- — basis to build their plant — build the electric generating plant.  They can fuel it with anything they want, and they may have coal as a backup.  Good, clean coal.\nYou know, if there were a problem with a — with a pipe coming in — as an example, you’re going with gas — oil or gas — and a pipe gets blown up or, for some reason, doesn’t work, there are some companies in the U.S. that have coal sitting right by the plant so that if there’s an emergency, they can go to that short-term basis and use our very clean coal.\nSo, that’s something else that a lot of people didn’t even know about.  But nothing can destroy coal — not the weather, not a bomb — nothing.  It might make it a little smaller, might make it a little different shape.  But coal is very strong as a backup.  It’s a great backup to have that facility, and it wouldn’t cost much more — more money.\nAnd we have more coal than anybody.  We also have more oil and gas than anybody.\nSo, we’re going to make it so that the plants will have their own electric generating facilities attached right to their plant.  They don’t have to worry about a utility.  They don’t have to worry about anything.  And we’re going to get very rapid approvals.\nMR. BRENDE:  Thank you.  Thank you so much, Mr. President.  We’ll now go to another CEO that you know very well: Brian Moynihan, the CEO and chair of Bank of America.\nMR. MOYNIHAN:  Good afternoon, Mr. President, and congratulations — an obviously eventful week for you and your family.\nIf you remember, five years ago, you came here and we walked among 150 CEOs from all over the world, and you engaged with them about your policies and your procedures.\nThis year, you’re not here.  And yet this week was eventful, from the orders that you mentioned earlier — literally a wave of orders coming out on immigration, on trade, and many other matters.\nAnd so, as a representative of the United States here,\nwe got a lot of questions about what does all this mean and how would the president square this with his clear focus on growth, prosperity, market gro- — stock market growth, a good bond market, and bringing down prices.\nSo, how do you think about the impact of all these orders and how fast they come out and how you’re going to balance them with that scorecard of being successful on both contan- — continuing GDP growth, bringing down inflation, and also having a good stock price appreciation for the American citizen?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it’s going to actually bring down inflation.  It’s going to bring up jobs.  We’re going to have a lot of jobs.  We’re going to have a lot of companies moving in.\nYou know, Brian, we’re at 21 percent.  It was at 40 percent, and I got it down to 21 percent — the corporate tax.  And it was — actually, if you look at state and city, it was, in many cases, much higher than 40 percent.  I got it down to 21 percent.  And now we’re going to bring it down from 21 to 15 percent if — this is a big “if” — if you make your product in the U.S.\nSo, we’re going to have the lowest — just about the lowest rate.  It will be — the 21 is on the low side worldwide; the 15 is about as low as it gets, and by far the lowest of a large country — a large, you know, rich, powerful country — by far, not even a contest.\nSo, we’re going to bring it down to 15 percent if you make your product in the USA.  So, that’s going to create a — a tremendous buzz.\nWe’re also probably going back to the one-year deduction, where we deduct — you know, we — we did that originally, and that was amazing what — the impact that that had, the one-year deduction, which built up over a period of time and then it expires.  But we’re going to go back to that when we do the renewal of the Trump tax plan.\nWe have to get Democrats to approve it.  But, you know, if the Democrats didn’t approve it, I don’t know how they can survive with about a 45 percent tax increase, because that’s what it would be.  And so, I think they’re going to b- — w- — we’ve been working along with them pretty well.\nI think it’s very hard for a political group to say, “Let’s charge people 45 percent more.”  So, I think we’re in good shape.\nBut we’re actually doing a reduction for business and small businesses, where you’re going to b- — bring it down to 15 percent, which is really something.\nAnd, by the way, speaking of you — and you’ve done a fantastic job — but I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America.  This conserve- — they don’t take conservative business.  And I don’t know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody, I hope you’re going to open your banks to conservatives, because what you’re doing is wrong.\nMR. MOYNIHAN:  Mr. President —\nMR. BRENDE:  (Inaudible.)\nMR. MOYNIHAN:  — I’ll say that your friend Gianni was — said hello — told me tell you hello, and we look forward to sponsoring the World Cup when it comes, both this summer for the club and next year.  So, thank you for getting that for the United States.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Brian.\nMR. BRENDE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We’ll now go to Ana Botín.  She’s the executive chairman of Banco Santander, one of the big European banks and also in the U.S.\nSo, Ana.\nMS. BOTÍN:  Mr. President, congratulations on a historic victory.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nMS. BOTÍN:  I believe you don’t know me as well as my fellow panelists, so a few words.  Santander is one of the largest banks in the world by number of customers, 170 million.  That’s more than my friend Brian or my friend Jamie have.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wow.\nMS. BOTÍN:  And those — (applause) —\nMR. MOYNIHAN:  If they fix the regulation (inaudible).\nMS. BOTÍN:  That’s coming.  That’s coming.\nMR. BRENDE:  That was cheeky.  (Laughter.)\nMS. BOTÍN:  We are — we are a big investor in the United States.  We have many million customer, 12,000 employees.  We’re one of the largest auto lenders, and we recently launched a fully digital bank called Openbank.\nWe strongly believe banks have a pivotal role in the economy, and we can accelerate growth and help many more customers.  That’s what we do in the United States.  So, as Brian pointed out, we very much welcome your focus on deregulation and reducing bureaucracy.\nSo, my question is: What are your priorities in this regard, and how fast is this going to happen?  Thank you very much.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it’s going to — thank you and congratulations.  I know very much about your bank, and you’ve done a fantastic job.  Congratulations.\nWe are going to move very quickly.  We’ve moved very quickly.  We’ve done things in the last three days that nobody thought were possible to do in years.  And it’s all taken — it’s all taken effect.  It’s going to have a huge impact on the economy, a huge positive impact.  Money was being wasted on crazy things.\nI mean, the Green New Deal was such a total disgrace — what — what — how that was perpetrated.  And it was conceived of by people that were average students — less than average students, I might add — and never even took a course in energy or the environment.  It was just a game.  Remember, the world was going to end in 12 years?  Remember that?  Well, the 12 years has come and gone.  It was going to end.  It was going to all foam into earth.  But, you know, the time has come.\nThe — these people — and they — they really — they really scared the Democrats large- — I can’t say the Republicans.  Republicans maybe could have fought harder to stop it, but it’s been a tremendous waste of — a tremendous waste of money.\nYou know, during my four years, we had the cleanest air, we had the cleanest water, and yet we had the most productive economy in the history of our country.  We had the most productive economy.  Until COVID came, we had the most productive in the history of our country, by far.\nAnd — and actually, you could look worldwide, we — we’re — we were beating everybody from China to everybody else.  So — and we think we really — now, with what we have learned and all of the other things that have taken place, we think we can even far surpass that — a- — actually, far, far surpass it.  But we do — one thing we’re going to be demanding is we’re going to — be demanding respect from other nations.\nCanada.  We have a tremendous deficit with Canada.  We’re not going to have that anymore.  We can’t do it.  It’s — it’s — I don’t know if it’s good for them.  As you probably know, I say, “You can always become a state, and if you’re a state, we won’t have a deficit.  We won’t have to tariff you, et cetera, et cetera.”\nBut Canada has been very tough to deal with over the years, and it’s not fair that we should have a $200 billion or $250 billion deficit.  We don’t need them to make our cars, and they make a lot of them.  We don’t need their lumber because we have our own forests, et cetera, et cetera.  We don’t need their oil and gas.  We have our — we have more than anybody.\nSo, you know, just as an example, with Mexico — we’re dealing with Mexico, I think, very well.  And we’re just — you know, w- — we just want to be treated fairly with other nations, because there’s hardly a nation in the world — and I blame this on us, and I blame it on politicians that for some reason — and probably mostly it’s stupidity, but you could also say other reasons, but mostly stupidity — they’ve allowed other nations to take advantage of the U.S.  And w- — we can’t allow that to happen anymore.\nYou know, we have debt.  It’s a very small debt when you compare it to value — the value of the assets that we have, but we don’t want to do that.  We want to just have debt be obliterated, and we’ll be able to do that fairly rapidly.  And a lot of good things are going to happen.\nAnd — and honestly, good things are going to happen for the world, and good things are going to happen for the people that are dealing with us — allies and beyond allies.\nOne thing — very important — I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon and get that war end — ended, and — and that’s not from the standpoint of economy or anything else.  It’s from the standpoint of millions of lives are being wasted.  Beautiful, young people are being shot in the battlefield.  You know, the bullet — a very flat land, as I said, and the bullet goes — there’s no — there’s no hiding.  And a bullet — the only thing going to stop the bullet is a human body.  And you have to see — I’ve seen pictures of what’s taken place.  It’s a carnage.\nAnd we really have to stop that war.  That war is horrible.  And I’m not talking economy, I’m not talking economics, I’m not talking about natural resource.  I’m just talking about: There’s so many young people being killed in this war, and that’s not including the people that have been killed as the cities are being, you know, knocked down building by building.  So, we really should get that stopped.\nLikewise, in the Middle East, I think we’ve made a lot of progress in the Middle East, and I think that’s going to — that’s going to come along pretty well.\nThank you very much.\nMR. BRENDE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We know that most consequential relationship in the world is between the U.S. and China.  U.S., 28 percent of the global economy; China close to 20.  That’s almost half of the global GDP.\nAnd we know that you called President Xi Jinping last Friday.  We heard that you had a good discussion.\nHow do you see the relationship between the U.S. and China in the next four years under your leadership?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He called me.  But I see it very good.  I think that we’re going to have a very good relationship.  All we want is fairness.  We just want a level playing field.  We don’t want to take advantage.  We’ve been having massive deficits with China.  Biden allowed it to get out of hand.  He’s — $1.1 trillion deficit.  It’s ridiculous, and it’s just an unfair relationship.\nAnd we have to make it just fair.  We don’t have to make it phenomenal.  We have to make it a fair relationship.  Right now, it’s not a fair relationship.  The deficit is massive, as it is with other countries — a lot of Asian countries, actually.  But we have deficits that are very big, and we can’t keep doing that, so we’re not going to keep doing that.\nBut I like President Xi very much.  I’ve always liked him.  We always had a very good relationship.  It was very strained with COVID coming out of Wuhan.  Obviously, that strained it.  I’m sure it strained it with a lot of people, but that strained our relationship.  But we always had a great relationship, I would say, and we look forward to doing very well with China and getting along with China.\nHopefully, China can help us stop the war with, in particular, Russia-Ukraine.  And they have a great deal of power over that situation, and we’ll work with them.\nAnd I mentioned that with — during our phone conversation with President Xi, and hopefully we could work together and get that stopped.\nWe’d like to see denuclearization.  In fact, with President Putin, prior to a — an election result, which was, frankly, ridiculous, we were talking about denuclearization of our two countries, and China would have come along.  China has a — a much smaller, right now, nuclear armament than us or field than us, but they’re — they’re going to be catching it at some point over the next four or five years.\nAnd I will tell you that President Putin really liked the idea of — of cutting way back on nuclear.  And I think the rest of the world, we would have gotten them to follow.  And China would have come along too.  China also liked it.\nTremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear, and the destructive capability is something that we don’t even want to talk about today, because you don’t want to hear it.  It’s too depressing.\nSo, we want to see if we can denuclearize, and I think that’s very possible.  And I can tell you that President Putin wanted to do it.  He and I wanted to do it.  We had a good conversation with China.  They would have been involved, and that would have been an unbelievable thing for the planet.\nAnd I hope —\nMR. BRENDE:  Mr. President, when you’re —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — it can be started up again.\nMR. BRENDE:  — back here in Davos next year, will — will there be then a peace agreement with — with Ukraine and Russia by then?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, you’re going to have to ask Russia.  Ukraine is ready to — to make a deal.\nJust so you understand, this is a war that should have never started.  If I were president, it would never have started.  This is a war that should have never, ever been started.  And — and it wasn’t started during my — there was never even talk about it.  I knew that it was the apple of President Putin’s eye, but I also knew that there was no way he was going in, and he wasn’t going to go in.\nAnd then, when I was out, bad things happened, bad things were said, a lot of stupidity all around, and you end up with what you have.  Now you have all these bombed-out cities — they look like demolition sites — with many people killed.\nI think the — the thing that you’ll see about Ukraine is that far — far more people have died than is being reported.  And I’ve seen that.  But far, far more people have died.\nWhen you look at a city that’s become a demolition site, where big buildings have been collapsed by missiles hitting them and everything else, and they say, “One person was slightly injured.”  No, no, many people were killed.  Those are big buildings.  I was surprised at how — that was my business.  These are buildings that go two and three blocks long.  They’re 20 stories high.  They’re big, powerful buildings.  Then they were knocked down, and there were a lot of people in those buildings.  They had announced that two people were injured.  That’s not true.  So, I think you’re going to find that there were many more people killed in Ukraine and the Ukraine war than anybody has any idea.\nBut if you look now, so many of the — the people being killed are soldiers just facing each other with guns, rifles, and drones — the new form of warfare — drones.  And it’s a very sad thing to see.\nAnd when you see pictures of the fields that I see, nobody wants to see it.  You’ll never be the same.\nMR. BRENDE:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  On behalf of all the 3,000 participants here in Davos, we really, really underline that joining us, the third day in your presidency, live, taking questions here, it’s so appreciated.  And we are already ready for receiving you next year in person.\nSo, thank you very much, and all the best from Davos.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND                11:49 A.M.

Trump signed an Executive Order Re-Designating Ansar Allah (also known as the Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\nThe Executive Order sets in motion a process by which Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthis, will be designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\nPresident Trump designated the Iranian-backed Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in January 2021.\nWithin one month of taking office, the Biden administration reversed the Houthis’ designation.\nAs a result of the Biden administration’s weak policy, the Houthis have fired at U.S. Navy warships dozens of times, launched numerous attacks on civilian infrastructure in partner nations, and attacked commercial vessels transiting Bab al-Mandeb more than 100 times.\nThe Executive Order directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with others, to recommend the re-designation of the Houthis within 30 days.\nUnder President Trump, it is now the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis’ capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby end their attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea.\nFollowing the Houthis’ re-designation as an FTO, the Executive Order also directs the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Secretary of State to jointly review United Nations partners, nongovernmental organizations, and contractors operating in Yemen.\nFollowing this review, the President will direct USAID to end its relationship with entities that have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis’ terrorism and abuses.",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nDESIGNATION OF ANSAR ALLAH AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 22, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101\net seq.\n) (INA), it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  This order sets in motion a process by which Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthis, shall be considered for designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, consistent with section 219 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1189).\nSupported by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC-QF), which arms and trains terrorist organizations worldwide, the Houthis have fired at U.S. Navy warships dozens of times since 2023, endangering American men and women in uniform.  Since seizing most Yemeni population centers by force from the legitimate Yemeni government in 2014-2015، the Houthis have launched numerous attacks on civilian infrastructure, including multiple attacks on civilian airports in Saudi Arabia, the deadly January 2022 attacks on the United Arab Emirates, and more than 300 projectiles fired at Israel since October 2023.  The Houthis have also attacked commercial vessels transiting Bab al-Mandeb more than 100 times, killing at least four civilian sailors and forcing some Red Sea maritime commercial traffic to reroute, which has contributed to global inflation.\nThe Houthis’ activities threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate Ansar Allah’s capabilities and operations, deprive it of resources, and thereby end its attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea.\nSec. 3.  Implementation.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall, after consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of the Treasury, submit a report to the President, through the National Security Council, concerning the designation of Ansar Allah as a foreign terrorist organization consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189.\n(b)  Within 15 days after submitting the report required under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of State shall take all appropriate action, consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189, with regards to a designation of Ansar Allah as a terrorist organization.\n(d)  Following any designation of Ansar Allah as a foreign terrorist organization under 8 U.S.C. 1189, the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) shall jointly conduct a review of the United Nations partners, nongovernmental organizations, and contractors through which USAID works in Yemen, and identify any entities with a relationship with USAID that has:\n(i)    made payments to members of, or governmental entities controlled by, Ansar Allah; or\n(ii)   has criticized international efforts to counter Ansar Allah while failing to document Ansar Allah’s abuses sufficiently.\n(e)  The Administrator of USAID shall take all appropriate action to terminate the projects, grants, or contracts identified under subsection (e) of this section as appropriate.\nSec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

    "text": "Briefings & Statements\nFACT SHEET: President Donald J. Trump Protects the States and the American People by Closing the Border to Illegals via Proclamation\nJanuary 22, 2025\nGUARANTEEING THE STATES PROTECTION AGAINST INVASION: Today, President Trump signed an Executive Order that suspends the physical entry of aliens engaged in an invasion of the United States through the southern border.\nIn joining the Union, the States agreed to surrender much of their sovereignty in exchange for the federal government’s promise in Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, to “protect each of [the States] against Invasion.”\nStates, such as the Great State of Texas, have asked the Federal Government for protection against invasion during the Biden Administration, but it failed to protect them from millions of illegal aliens entering the United States, invading their communities, and imposing billions of dollars of costs upon State and local governments.\nThe President has the authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as well as inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution, to prevent the physical entry of illegal aliens into the United States across the southern border.\nDIRECTION TO IMMEDIATELY REPEL, REPATRIATE, AND REMOVE ILLEGAL ALIENS INVOLVED IN AN INVASION:\nThrough the exercise of his authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Constitution of the United States, President Trump is authorizing and directing the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Department of State to take all necessary action to immediately repel, repatriate, and remove illegal aliens across the southern border of the United States.\nThrough the exercise of his authority, President Trump has further restricted access to the provisions of the immigration laws that would enable any illegal alien involved in an invasion across the southern border of the United States to remain in the United States, such as asylum.\nPROMISES KEPT: In 2024, President Trump promised to “seal the border on Day 1.”\nAs President Trump described in 2018: “Illegal immigration affects the lives of all Americans. Illegal immigration hurts American workers; burdens American taxpayers; and undermines public safety; and places enormous strain on local schools, hospitals, and communities in general, taking precious resources away from the poorest Americans who need them most. Illegal immigration costs our country billions and billions of dollars each year…And I will therefore take every lawful action at my disposal to address this crisis. And that’s what we’re doing.”",

    "text": "Briefings & Statements\nFact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Declares a National Emergency at the Southern Border\nJanuary 22, 2025\nINVOKING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order invoking the National Emergencies Act regarding the crisis at the Southern Border of the United States.\nThe Executive Order declares a national emergency at the southern border following four years of record-shattering illegal immigration into the U.S.\nIt directs the Secretary of Defense to deploy additional personnel to the border, including members of the Armed Forces and the National Guard.\nAdditionally, it directs the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to finish the wall along the southern border and ensures that DHS has all the flexibility it needs to operate air missions near the border.\nTAKING BACK CONTROL: For the past four years, the federal government has abdicated its responsibility to enforce the border, resulting in a catastrophic immigration crisis for the United States.\nWhen States like Texas took steps to prevent illegal crossings into their state, the federal government sought to stop them by cutting down their barriers.\nA record-shattering 8.72 million border encounters have occurred at the southern border from FY21-FY24, overwhelming border resources and endangering communities.\nThis has led to untold hundreds of thousands of children being trafficked.  Roughly 550,000 unaccompanied alien children have been encountered at the border since FY21.  Fentanyl and other drugs are pouring over the border and flooding our communities, killing roughly 75,000 Americans in 2023—the number one cause of death for Americans ages 18-45.\nIt has allowed dangerous gangs like the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua to takeover and terrorize entire American cities.\nAnd it has led to the murders of innocent Americans like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, and many others.\nBUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS: America is in a dire situation, and it is past time for the government to act. President Trump first declared an emergency at the Southern Border on February 15, 2019, and continued that emergency on\nFebruary 13, 2020\n.\nFollowing the at-the-time historic surges of illegal aliens in 2018, President Trump declared a national emergency and successfully reduced the number of people seeking to enter the country illegally.\nIn 2024, President Trump promised to declare an emergency to secure the border and use the military where necessary to protect Americans from foreign threats.\nThis Executive Order will allow the government to gain operational control of the border, combat the cartels, and secure our nation.\nAs President Trump described in 2018: “Illegal immigration affects the lives of all Americans. Illegal immigration hurts American workers; burdens American taxpayers; and undermines public safety; and places enormous strain on local schools, hospitals, and communities in general, taking precious resources away from the poorest Americans who need them most.

    "text": "Briefings & Statements\nFact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Delivers Emergency Price Relief for American Families to Defeat the Cost-of-Living Crisis\nJanuary 22, 2025\nDELIVERING EMERGENCY PRICE RELIEF: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to deliver emergency price relief for American families and defeat the cost-of-living crisis.\nThe Presidential Memorandum recognizes a critical component of the crushing cost of everyday living. The Biden Administration imposed complex regulatory burdens and radical policies designed to weaken American production.\nPresident Trump is ordering all Federal agencies to untangle the American economy from Biden constraints and improve affordability of necessary goods and services and increase the prosperity of the American workers.\nThis includes action to:\nDrastically lower the cost of housing and expand housing supply;\nEliminate unnecessary administrative expenses and rent-seeking practices that drive up healthcare costs;\nEliminate counterproductive requirements raising the costs of home appliances;\nCreate employment opportunities for American workers including drawing discouraged workers into the labor force; and\nEliminate harmful, coercive “climate” policies driving up the costs of food and fuel.\nENDING BIDEN’S WAR ON AFFORDABILITY: The Biden Administration’s destructive policies inflicted an historic inflation crisis on the American people.\nHardworking families are overwhelmed today by the cost of fuel, food, housing, automobiles, medical care, utilities, and insurance.\nUnprecedented regulatory oppression from the Biden Administration has imposed almost $50,000 in costs on the average American household, whereas President Trump’s first-term agenda reduced regulatory costs by almost $11,000 per household.\nAmericans are unable to purchase homes at historic rates, in part due to regulatory requirements that alone account for 25 percent of the cost of constructing a new home.\nBiden’s assault on plentiful and reliable American energy through impossible, unnecessary, and illegal regulatory demands have driven up the cost of transportation and manufacturing.\nBiden’s war on energy has been a war on American consumers. American households are paying an average of $1,200 more per year in energy costs under President Biden’s policies. Since he took office, total energy costs rose by 36%, gasoline rose 41%, home energy costs rose 30%, electricity bills rose 29%, and gas bills rose 34%.\nAfter averaging just $2.77 per gallon under President Trump, and a price of $2.33 upon leaving office, the price of gasoline skyrocketed under President Biden, reaching $3.33 a year later. It went on to reach a peak at $5.00 per gallon and remains elevated today.\nThe unlawful regulatory mandate on companies to eliminate gas-powered vehicles has resulted in artificial price increases in order to subsidize electric vehicles, largely disfavored by consumers.",

Trump.  (Applause.)\nSo, do we want to hear from the 45th and 47th president of the United States?  (Applause.)\nTake it away, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, JD.\nThis is a hell of a day we’re having, right?  (Applause.)\nIt began very early, and then we decided — you know, we made a good decision, by the way, doing it in the rotunda, as opposed to in about four degrees with the windchill factor.  That would not have been pretty.\nAnd, you know, if I made us — did you ever speak in really cold weather?  You can’t.  They would say — the fake news over there, they’d say, “He’s cognitively impaired.  There’s something wrong with him.”  (Laughter.)  So, we didn’t want to give them the chance to do that, did we?\nWe had a — a great time.  We had 72-degree temperature in the rotunda.  We had the people that we needed.  And we had the people that we need tonight, because you guys are unbelievable.  We love you all.  (Applause.)\nAnd we said a lot of things today.  I think we got tremendous reviews on the speech.  And, you know, I wanted to put in some really rough stuff, and all of my people, including JD, they said, “You know, let’s not put that paragraph in.”  Oh, I loved that paragraph.  (Laughter.)  There was a paragraph on “Biden shouldn’t be pardoning his family.”  (Applause.)  And we had a couple of others that were far worse than that.\nBut they said, “You know, the speech is so nice and it’s so unifying.”  I said, “All right, we won’t do it.  I’ll do it about two hours later.”  So, we’ve done — (laughter) — we’ve been doing it all night long.\nBut, you know, we’re going to turn this country around and fast.  (Applause.)  We have — we have assets like nobody else.  Number one, we have our people.  That’s our greatest asset, the people of our country.  (Applause.)\nAnd I just — and I have a great family.  I really do.  I — I just look around.  My son Eric has been so incredible, married to a woman who became the head of the Republican Party.  I wonder, how the hell did that happen?  (Applause.)  And she’s — she really — her and Michael Whatley, from North Carolina, did a great job.  (Applause.)\nAnd then you have — where is my Ivanka?  Have you ever heard of Ivanka and Jared?  (Applause.)\nAnd we have — Tiffany is here someplace.  There’s Tiffany.  Have — with — with child, I have to say.  (Applause.)  And Michael.  Thank you very much.\nAnd what — look at that group back there.  That’s Kai, our great golfer.  She — a great golfer, that one.  (Applause.)\nAnd Don and Don and Chloe.  Chloe — I don’t know, Ivanka, she might be as good as this one.  You have to see her athletic ability.  You wouldn’t believe it.  You look at her, she looks so innocent.  She’s a killer.  (Laughter.)  Chloe is a killer.\nAnd we have a great vice president, I want to tell you, and a fantastic — (applause) — and he’s got a fantastic wife and helper, and she’s done — she’s done just incredible things for the party and for him.  And I want to thank you.  Great job.  Great job.  JD Vance, great job.  (Applause.)\nSo — so, we’re going to keep it going.  We’re going to have it turned around quickly.  This big ship, we got to turn it a little bit slower than I’d like, but we’re going to turn it around.\nWe have things that nobody else has.  You know, we — we also have something that — it’s not politically correct to say, but it’s becoming very politically correct: We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation in the world.  (Applause.)  And if you don’t mind, we’re going to use it, right?  (Applause.)\nAnd we just left the Commander in Chief Ball, which is, like, a similar size.  Everyone — and we’re going to another one in a little while.  We needed three because we have such support.  There’s a longing for competence in this country.  There’s a longing for common sense in this country.\nAnd I was saying before, with a party of common sense, you know, we — we don’t want to have men playing in women’s sports.  (Applause.)  We don’t want to have transgender operations for everyone.  (Applause.)  And we just want to have a great country.\nWan- — we want education.  We want houses that don’t cost a fortune.  We want low interest rates.  We want low taxes.  We want a strong, powerful military, and we’re going to have that.\nWe did it once.  We did it in 2017.  We rebuilt our entire military.  It was given away, a lot of it.  Can you believe it? Given away — so foolishly given away, but we’ll have it back again very, very soon.\nAnd we’ll be making some announcements.  You’re going to be so thrilled.\nBut we love you all.  We’re going to be — you know, I’d like to say we are a great nation.  We will soon be the greatest we’ve ever been, and that won’t take long.\nSo, I want to thank you all for being here tonight, special people, and we’ll see you soon.  Just watch what happens.  Going to be big progress.  (Applause.)\nThank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\n(The Village People perform “Y.M.C.A.”)\nMR.

  "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects Civil Rights and Merit-Based Opportunity by Ending Illegal DEI": {
    "text": "Briefings & Statements\nFact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects Civil Rights and Merit-Based Opportunity by Ending Illegal DEI\nJanuary 22, 2025\nPROTECTING CIVIL RIGHTS AND EXPANDING INDIVIDUAL OPPORTUNITY\n: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an historic Executive Order that protects the civil rights of all Americans and expands individual opportunity by terminating radical DEI preferencing in federal contracting and directing federal agencies to relentlessly combat private sector discrimination. It enforces long-standing federal statutes and faithfully advances the Constitution’s promise of colorblind equality before the law. This comprehensive order is the most important federal civil rights measure in decades:\nIt terminates “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) discrimination in the federal workforce, and in federal contracting and spending.\nFederal hiring, promotions, and performance reviews will reward individual initiative, skills, performance, and hard work and not, under any circumstances, DEI-related factors, goals, policies, mandates, or requirements.\nThe order requires OMB to streamline the federal contracting process to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil rights laws.\nIt revokes Executive Order 11246 contracting criteria mandating affirmative action\nIt bars the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs from pushing contractors to balance their workforce based on race, sex, gender identity, sexual preference, or religion.\nIt requires simple and unmistakable affirmation that contractors will not engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.\nIt directs all departments and agencies to take strong action to end private sector DEI discrimination, including civil compliance investigations.\nIt mandates the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education issue joint guidance regarding the measures and practices required to comply with the Supreme Court’s decision in\nStudents for Fair Admissions v. Harvard\n.\nRESTORING THE VALUES OF INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY, HARD WORK, AND EXCELLENCE\n: Individual dignity, hard work, and excellence are fundamental to American greatness. This Executive Order reaffirms these values by ending the Biden-Harris Administration’s anti-constitutional and deeply demeaning “equity” mandates, terminating DEI, and protecting civil rights:\nReversing the progress made in the decades since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 toward a colorblind and competence-based workplace, radical DEI has dangerously tainted many of our critical businesses and influential institutions, including the federal government.\nIn the private sector, many corporations and universities use DEI as an excuse for biased and unlawful employment practices and illegal admissions preferences, ignoring the fact that DEI’s foundational rhetoric and ideas foster intergroup hostility and authoritarianism.\nBillions of dollars are spent annually on DEI, but rather than reducing bias and promoting inclusion, DEI creates and then amplifies prejudicial hostility and exacerbates interpersonal conflict.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED AND DELIVERED\n: President Trump promised to terminate DEI in the federal government, protect equal opportunity, and force schools to end discriminatory admissions policies, and he delivered. Every man and woman should have the opportunity to go as far as their hard work, individual initiative, and competence can take them. In America, excellence, grit, and determination is our strength.",

    "text": "Briefings & Statements\nFact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ends DEI Madness and Restores Excellence and Safety within the Federal Aviation Administration\nJanuary 22, 2025\nFLIGHTS SHOULD BE SUPERVISED BY THE BEST EMPLOYEES: President Donald J. Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum terminating a Biden Administration Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) hiring policy that prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) over safety and efficiency.\nThis Presidential Memorandum orders the Secretary of Transportation and FAA Administrator to immediately stop Biden DEI hiring programs and return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring.\nIt also requires the FAA Administrator to review the past performance and performance standards of all FAA employees in critical safety positions and make clear that any individual who fails to demonstrate adequate capability is replaced by someone who will ensure Americans’ flight safety and efficiency.\nMILLIONS OF AMERICANS RELY ON SAFE, TIMELY AIR TRAVEL EVERY DAY: Safety and competence should be the only job criteria for FAA employees, yet the Biden Administration violated the public trust—as well as the law—by prioritizing illegal DEI hiring.\nEvery day, more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million airline passengers traveling for work or fun or to visit friends and family entrust their lives to the FAA.\nAlmost unbelievably, as a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative, the Biden FAA specifically recruited and hired individuals with “severe intellectual” disabilities, psychiatric issues, and complete paralysis over other individuals who sought to work for the FAA.\nPresident Trump is immediately terminating this illegal and dangerous program and requiring that all FAA hiring be based solely on ensuring the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence.\nOn January 11, 2023, two weeks after a major holiday airline crisis, an FAA system outage caused by employees missteps grounded all flights for the first time since 9/11, an illustration of the importance of FAA competence.\nFULFILLING PROMISE TO END ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION AND BRING BACK COMMON SENSE: This Presidential Memorandum builds on President Trump’s day-one Executive Order ending the Biden Administration’s illegal and immoral DEI discrimination programs.\nIn his inaugural address, President Trump promised: ““We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.”\nPresident Trump stated in his January 20, 2025 Executive Order on Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing: “Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great.”",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nENDING ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION AND\nRESTORING MERIT-BASED OPPORTUNITY\nJanuary 21, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Longstanding Federal civil-rights laws protect individual Americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  These civil-rights protections serve as a bedrock supporting equality of opportunity for all Americans.  As President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all Americans.\nYet today, roughly 60 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, critical and influential institutions of American society, including the Federal Government, major corporations, financial institutions, the medical industry, large commercial airlines, law enforcement agencies, and institutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) or “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility” (DEIA) that can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation.\nIllegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system.  Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex.\nThese illegal DEI and DEIA policies also threaten the safety of American men, women, and children across the Nation by diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society, including all levels of government, and the medical, aviation, and law-enforcement communities.  Yet in case after tragic case, the American people have witnessed first-hand the disastrous consequences of illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.\nThe Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws.  The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence, and hard work.  I therefore order all executive departments and agencies (agencies) to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements.  I further order all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\nSec. 3.  Terminating Illegal Discrimination in the Federal Government.  (a)  The following executive actions are hereby revoked:\n(i)    Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations);\n(ii)   Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce);\n(iii)  Executive Order 13672 of July 21, 2014 (Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity); and\n(iv)   The Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016 (Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce).\n(b)  The Federal contracting process shall be streamlined to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil-rights laws.  Accordingly:\n(i)    Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment Opportunity), is hereby revoked.  For 90 days from the date of this order, Federal contractors may continue to comply with the regulatory scheme in effect on January 20, 2025.\n(ii)   The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs within the Department of Labor shall immediately cease:\n(A)  Promoting “diversity”;\n(B)  Holding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for taking “affirmative action”; and\n(C)  Allowing or encouraging Federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in workforce balancing based on race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin.\n(iii)  In accordance with Executive Order 13279 of December 12, 2002 (Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations), the employment, procurement, and contracting practices of Federal contractors and subcontractors shall not consider race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin in ways that violate the Nation’s civil rights laws.\n(iv)   The head of each agency shall include in every contract or grant award:\n(A)  A term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to agree that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the government’s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code; and\n(B)  A term requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.\n(c)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall:\n(i)    Review and revise, as appropriate, all Government-wide processes, directives, and guidance;\n(ii)   Excise references to DEI and DEIA principles, under whatever name they may appear, from Federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures to streamline those procedures, improve speed and efficiency, lower costs, and comply with civil-rights laws; and\n(iii)  Terminate all “diversity,” “equity,” “equitable decision-making,” “equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,” “advancing equity,” and like mandates, requirements, programs, or activities, as appropriate.\nSec. 4.  Encouraging the Private Sector to End Illegal DEI Discrimination and Preferences.  (a)  The heads of all agencies, with the assistance of the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action with respect to the operations of their agencies to advance in the private sector the policy of individual initiative, excellence, and hard work identified in section 2 of this order.\n(b)  To further inform and advise me so that my Administration may formulate appropriate and effective civil-rights policy, the Attorney General, within 120 days of this order, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies and in coordination with the Director of OMB, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy containing recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.  The report shall contain a proposed strategic enforcement plan identifying:\n(i)    Key sectors of concern within each agency’s jurisdiction;\n(ii)   The most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern;\n(iii)  A plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles (whether specifically denominated “DEI” or otherwise) that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.  As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars;\n(iv)   Other strategies to encourage the private sector to end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences and comply with all Federal civil-rights laws;\n(v)    Litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest; and\n(vi)   Potential regulatory action and sub-regulatory guidance.\nSec. 5.  Other Actions.  Within 120 days of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education shall jointly issue guidance to all State and local educational agencies that receive Federal funds, as well as all institutions of higher education that receive Federal grants or participate in the Federal student loan assistance program under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq., regarding the measures and practices required to comply with Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023).\nSec. 6.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 7.  Scope.  (a)  This order does not apply to lawful Federal or private-sector employment and contracting preferences for veterans of the U.S. armed forces or persons protected by the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 et seq.\n(b)  This order does not prevent State or local governments, Federal contractors, or Federally-funded State and local educational agencies or institutions of higher education from engaging in First Amendment-protected speech.\n(c)  This order does not prohibit persons teaching at a Federally funded institution of higher education as part of a larger course of academic instruction from advocating for, endorsing, or promoting the unlawful employment or contracting practices prohibited by this order.\nSec. 8.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 21, 2025.",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nKeeping Americans Safe in Aviation\nJanuary 21, 2025\nSUBJECT:       Keeping Americans Safe in Aviation\nEvery day, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), within the U.S. Department of Transportation, oversees safety for more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million airline passengers.  These Americans trust the FAA’s public servants with their lives, and it is therefore imperative that they maintain a commitment to excellence and efficiency.\nDuring the prior administration, however, the FAA betrayed its mission by elevating dangerous discrimination over excellence.  For example, prior to my Inauguration, the FAA Diversity and Inclusion website revealed that the prior administration sought to specifically recruit and hire individuals with serious infirmities that could impact the execution of their essential life-saving duties.\nIllegal and discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring, including on the basis of race, sex, disability, or any other criteria other than the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence, competency, and qualification, harms all Americans, who deserve to fly with confidence.  It also penalizes hard-working Americans who want to serve in the FAA but are unable to do so, as they lack a requisite disability or skin color.  FAA employees must hold the qualifications and have the ability to perform their jobs to the highest possible standard of excellence.\nI hereby order the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administrator to immediately return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring, as required by law.  All so-called DEI initiatives, including all dangerous preferencing policies or practices, shall immediately be rescinded in favor of hiring, promoting, and otherwise treating employees on the basis of individual capability, competence, achievement, and dedication.\nThe Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administrator shall review the past performance and performance standards of all individuals in critical safety positions and take all appropriate action to ensure that any individual who fails or has failed to demonstrate requisite capability is replaced by a high-capability individual that will ensure top-notch air safety and efficiency.",

    "text": "Remarks\nRemarks by President Trump and Vice President Vance at Starlight Ball\nJanuary 21, 2025\nUnion Station\nWashington, D.C.\n12:17 A.M. EST\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  How we doing?  (Applause.)  Isn’t it a great day to make the 45th president of the United States the 47th president of the United States?  (Applause.)\nJust say, first of all, thank you to all of you for your support, for your kindness, for your friendship, for believing enough in this country to fight for it and make Donald J. Trump the president America needs at this moment in time.  (Applause.)\nWe love you, and we’re grateful to you.\nAnd, second, I want to thank the president for his trust that he’s placed in me but, most importantly, for the willingness to sacrifice, to serve, to fight through all — let’s be honest and call it what it is — fight through all of the lies and the bullshit to serve the American people.  (Applause.)\nSo, I want to introduce the 45th and 47th president of the United States.  And we are lucky to have him.\nGod bless you all.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, JD.  And it’s great to have you all.  And, by the way, JD is doing a great job.  You know that.  We picked — we picked the right person.  (Applause.)\nBut I especially want to thank the people in this room.  You know, many of you are donors.  Some of you are large donors.  You believed in us very early.  Some of you believed in us from 2015.  (Applause.)  But you believed in us — there’s a lot of people out there.\nAnd — and 2016 was a great year.  And then we did much better in 2020, much — we got 10 or 12 million more votes.  And I don’t know what happened, but I knew — I said, “We’re doing this again.  We’re going to make it too big to rig.”  And that’s what happened.\nWe had the best numbers anyone has ever seen in the history of the Republican Party, actually.  Got the biggest vote in the history of the Republican Party and I guess in most of the history of the Democrat Party too, because we won in a landslide.  We won the seven swing states, and we won the popular vote.  It’s nice to be popular.  It’s very nice to be popular.  (Applause.)  And we won it — we won it by millions of votes.\nSo, I just want to thank everybody, because this really is a very special room.  And this is the one we chose to come to last.  That’s supposed to be a good thing, and it is a good thing, because we have so many friends in the crowd but, really, friends that supported us.\nWe had a — an incredible day today at the inauguration, and I’ve gotten good reviews on the speech.  You know, they made me take some of the rather difficult things — Melania said to me, “You know, you could do without a couple of those paragraphs.”  (Laughter.)  And we listened, and we listened to some others.\nWe have some tremendous professionals.  Susie Wiles is doing a fantastic job.  (Applause.)  (Inaudible.)\nAnd we had great people — great people on the campaign.  The campaign was so beautiful.  That last 120 days, I didn’t sleep one night.  I mean, literally, we just kept going, going, going — no days off, no vacation days.  And we kept hearing the other side was going to take a couple of days off during the week.\nI remember there were 14 days, then 17 days, and I heard that our opponent was going to take about 5 days off.  I said, “How do you do that when you’re going for the big one?”  (Laughter.)\nBut we worked very hard.  And I really think we outworked them, but we also out-thought them.  Work is wonderful, but you have to be able to think.\nAnd now we have the job of bringing our country back because we have the embarrassment of having other countries dumping prisoners and mental institution patients into our country with a stupid open border.\nAs you know, the border was closed at exactly 1:05 in the afternoon today.  (Applause.)  And I don’t mean closed; I mean really closed.  It’s closed.\nAnd we’re going to — we have no choice.  It’s not that I want to do this.  Dwight Eisenhower, a very moderate president, has the record.  He just couldn’t stand when people poured into the country.  He has the record for getting people out that shouldn’t be here.  And, you know, we’re going to far exceed that — not that I want to brag about it, because I hate having to do it.\nThey should have never done this to our country.  They should have never let this happen.  You know that this is happening with countries all over the world, and you know their crime rates are going down by 10 and 15 and 20 percent every six months?  Venezuela, their crime rate is down by 74.2 percent because they took their street criminals, their prisoners, and their mental patients, and they brought them into the United States of America.  Who the hell can think that’s a good thing?  But we’re getting them out, and we’re strengthening everything we have.\nWe have something that nobody else has.  We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country in the world.  (Applause.)  And if you don’t mind — now, if you do mind, I will not do it — if you don’t mind, we’re going to use it.  We’re going to use it.\nAnd — and through a system of good deals and renegotiating all of these terrible deals — we made some good — really good ones in 2016, but some of the best ones we made were terminated by this Biden administration and gave them back everything they wanted, these other countries, even if they’re allies.\nAnd we have some allies from countries right in this room — big, big people in countries.  So, I hate to embarrass them, but some of our allies are really — they treat us worse than the enemies on trade.  We’re not going to let that happen.\nSo, we’re going to do things that really started three months ago.  We won the election, and that was a big, big — November 5th, that was a big day.  And I want to make that the most consequential election in the history of our country.  It’s going to be the most consequential.\nWe’re going to turn it around very fast.  It’s a big, big ship, but we’re turning it as fast as a big ship can be turned.  And we’re going to make America great again.  (Applause.)\nAnd I just want to thank everybody in — in this large room, because it’s packed.  And the beautiful thing is we have two other rooms that are massive, and you couldn’t get in.  No matter what you did, you couldn’t get in.  And it’s just a great tribute to everybody here and to the people on stage.\nMy family has been so great.  Everyone in this — on this floor.\nDid — has anybody ever heard of Eric Trump?  (Applause.)  He’s got more subpoenas than anybody in the history of the United States.  (Laughter.)  They were after their political opponent.  How did that work out?  Not so good.\nThey got us a lot of votes.  Can you believe it?  That’s the first time that’s ever happened, actually.\nBut I just want to thank everybody very much, and I want to thank our first lady.  People love our first lady.  (Applause.)  And she’s done a fantastic job.\nAnd we’re going to have a tremendous four years, and hopefully it’s going to go long beyond four years.  We have some tremendous talent, including this guy right here.  Hopefully, it’s going to go long beyond four years.\nSo, again, I want to thank you for your confidence.  I want to especially thank those people — JD — that were here in 2015 before I really started.  And there’s a lot of them in the room, and they just stuck.  And they said, “We got to do it again, sir.  We got to do it again.”  And we did it again, and we won in record fashion.  So, it was a landslide.  It was a mandate like nobody has had before.\nSo, thank you all very much.  We love you all.  And we’re going to do a real job for you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, everybody.  (Applause.)\nEND                    12:24 A.M.

  "Guaranteeing The States Protection Against Invasion": {
    "text": "Presidential Actions\nGUARANTEEING THE STATES PROTECTION AGAINST INVASION\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\nA PROCLAMATION\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby proclaim:\nAn essential feature of any sovereign nation is the existence of territorial boundaries and the inherent authority to decide who and what may cross those boundaries.  The Supreme Court of the United States has described this power as a “fundamental act of sovereignty,” which “stems not alone from legislative power but is inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the nation.”\nU.S. ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy\n, 338 U.S. 537, 542 (1950).  The Supreme Court has recognized the inherent right and duty of the Executive Branch to defend our national sovereignty, stating that “[w]hen Congress prescribes a procedure concerning the admissibility of aliens, it is not dealing alone with a legislative power.  It is implementing an inherent executive power.”\nId.\nThe Congress has, in establishing “an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” created a complex and comprehensive Federal scheme in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101\net seq\n., to control the entry and exit of people and goods across the borders of the United States.  In routine circumstances, this complex and comprehensive scheme can protect the national sovereignty of the United States by facilitating the admission of individuals whose presence serves the national interest and preventing the admission of those who do not, such as those aliens who pose threats to public health, section 212(a)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(1); safety, section 212(a)(2) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)); and national security, section 212(a)(3) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)).  Prospective immigrants who use the visa system are screened for such health, safety, and security concerns while outside of the United States, and are not permitted to enter the United States until they establish that they are eligible to be admitted as a matter of law and should be admitted as a matter of discretion.\nBut screening under those provisions of the INA can be wholly ineffective in the border environment, where access to necessary information is limited for aliens who have traveled from countries around the world to enter the United States illegally, or when the system is overwhelmed, leading to the unauthorized entry of innumerable illegal aliens into the United States.\nDue to significant information gaps — particularly in the border environment — and processing times, Federal officials do not have the ability to verify with certainty the criminal record or national-security risks associated with the illegal entry of every alien at the southern border, as required by section 212(a)(2)-(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)-(3).  Nor do aliens who illegally cross the southern border readily provide comprehensive background information from their home countries to Federal law enforcement officials.\nThe public safety and national security risks in such an environment are heightened by the presence of, and control of territory by, international cartels and other transnational criminal organizations on the other side of the southern border, as well as terrorists and other malign actors who intend to harm the United States and the American people.  And the risks associated with these issues are greatly exacerbated when the number of aliens illegally crossing the southern border increases to levels that prevent actual operational control of the border.\nThe same is true for public health, where the Federal Government currently lacks an effective operational capability to screen all illegal aliens crossing the southern border for communicable diseases of public-health concern, as required by section 212(a)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(1).  Effectively no aliens who illegally enter the United States provide Federal officials at the southern border with their comprehensive health information, as a lawful immigrant would.  As a result, innumerable aliens potentially carrying communicable diseases of public health significance illegally cross the southern border and enter communities across the United States.\nOver the last 4 years, at least 8 million illegal aliens were encountered along the southern border of the United States, and countless millions more evaded detection and illegally entered the United States.  The sheer number of aliens entering the United States has overwhelmed the system and rendered many of the INA’s provisions ineffective, including those previously described that are intended to prevent aliens posing threats to public health, safety, and national security from entering the United States.  As a result, millions of aliens who potentially pose significant threats to health, safety, and national security have moved into communities nationwide.\nThis ongoing influx of illegal aliens across the southern border of the United States has placed significant costs and constraints upon the States, which have collectively spent billions of dollars in providing medical care and related human services, and have spent considerable amounts on increased law enforcement costs associated with the presence of these illegal aliens within their boundaries.\nIn joining the Union, the States agreed to surrender much of their sovereignty and join the Union in exchange for the Federal Government’s promise in Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, to “protect each of [the States] against Invasion.”  I have determined that the current state of the southern border reveals that the Federal Government has failed in fulfilling this obligation to the States and hereby declare that an invasion is ongoing at the southern border, which requires the Federal Government to take measures to fulfill its obligation to the States.\nThe INA provides the President with certain emergency tools.  For example, it states that “[w]henever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.”  8 U.S.C. 1182(f).  This statute “exudes deference to the President in every clause.”\nTrump v. Hawaii\n, 585 U.S. 667, 684 (2018).  Further, the INA renders it unlawful for “any alien to depart from or enter or attempt to depart from or enter the United States except under such reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may prescribe.”  8 U.S.C. 1185(a)(1).\nHistorically, Presidents have used these statutory authorities to deny entry of designated classes and categories of aliens into the United States through ports of entry.  But if the President has the power to deny entry of any alien into the United States, and to impose any restrictions as he may deem appropriate, this authority necessarily includes the right to deny the physical entry of aliens into the United States and impose restrictions on access to portions of the immigration system, particularly when the number of aliens illegally crossing the southern border prevents the Federal Government from obtaining operational control of the border.\nThe INA does not, however, occupy the Federal Government’s field of authority to protect the sovereignty of the United States, particularly in times of emergency when entire provisions of the INA are rendered ineffective by operational constraints, such as when there is an ongoing invasion into the States.  The President’s inherent powers to control the borders of the United States, including those deriving from his authority to control the foreign affairs of the United States, necessarily include the ability to prevent the physical entry of aliens involved in an invasion into the United States, and to rapidly repatriate them to an alternative location.  Only through such measures can the President guarantee the right of each State to be protected against invasion.\nBy the power vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, I have determined that the current situation at the southern border qualifies as an invasion under Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution of the United States.  Accordingly, I am issuing this Proclamation based on my express and inherent powers in Article II of the Constitution of the United States, and in faithful execution of the immigration laws passed by the Congress, and suspending the physical entry of aliens involved in an invasion into the United States across the southern border until I determine that the invasion has concluded.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby direct as follows:\nSection 1.  Suspension of Entry.  I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the entry into the United States on or after the date of this order of aliens engaged in the invasion across the southern border is detrimental to the interests of the United States.  I therefore direct that entry into the United States of such aliens be suspended until I issue a finding that the invasion at the southern border has ceased.\nSec. 2.  Imposition of Restrictions on Entry for Aliens Invading the United States.  I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that aliens engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States on or after the date of this proclamation are restricted from invoking provisions of the INA that would permit their continued presence in the United States, including, but not limited to, section 208 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1158, until I issue a finding that the invasion at the southern border has ceased.\nSec. 3.  Suspension of and Restriction on Entry for Aliens Posing Public Health, Safety, or National Security Risks.  I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the entry into the United States, on or after the date of this order, of any alien who fails, before entering the United States, to provide Federal officials with sufficient medical information and reliable criminal history and background information as to enable fulfillment of the requirements of sections 212(a)(1)-(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(1)-(3), is detrimental to the interests of the United States.  I therefore direct that entry into the United States of such aliens be suspended and restrict their access to provisions of the INA that would permit their continued presence in the United States, including, but not limited to, section 208 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1158.\nSec. 4.  Constitutional Suspension of Physical Entry.  Under the authorities provided to me under Article II of the Constitution of the United States, including my control over foreign affairs, and to effectuate the guarantee of protection against invasion required by Article IV, Section 4, I hereby suspend the physical entry of any alien engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States, and direct the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, to take appropriate actions as may be necessary to achieve the objectives of this proclamation, until I issue a finding that the invasion at the southern border has ceased.\nSec. 5.  Operational Actions to Repel the Invasion.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to repel, repatriate, or remove any alien engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States on or after the date of this order, whether as an exercise of the suspension power in section 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), or as an exercise of my delegated authority under the Constitution of the United States, until I issue a finding that the invasion at the southern border has ceased.\nSec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii\n)  the\nfunctions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.",

  "Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness": {
    "text": "Presidential Actions\nRESTORING NAMES THAT HONOR AMERICAN GREATNESS\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose and Policy.  It is in the national interest to promote the extraordinary heritage of our Nation and ensure future generations of American citizens celebrate the legacy of our American heroes.  The naming of our national treasures, including breathtaking natural wonders and historic works of art, should honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans in our Nation’s rich past.\nSec. 2.  Appointments to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.  (a)  Within seven days of the date of this order, each agency head with authority to appoint members to the Board on Geographic Names (Board) pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 364a, shall review their respective appointees and consider replacing those appointees in accordance with applicable law.\n(b)  The Secretary of the Interior shall review and consider additional appointments to the Board to assist in fulfilling all aspects of this order, subject to all applicable laws.\n(c)  With respect to all applications for naming and renaming submitted to the newly constituted Board, the Board shall advance the policy established in section 1 of this order to honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans and may update its principles, policies, and procedures as needed to achieve this policy.\n(d)  Where Congressional action is required to establish a renaming in public law, following Board approval on renaming, the Board shall provide guidance to all relevant Federal agencies to use the Board-approved name in the interim in federal documents and achieve consistency across the federal government.\nSec. 3.  Renaming of Mount McKinley.  (a)  President William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States, heroically led our Nation to victory in the Spanish-American War.  Under his leadership, the United States enjoyed rapid economic growth and prosperity, including an expansion of territorial gains for the Nation.  President McKinley championed tariffs to protect U.S. manufacturing, boost domestic production, and drive U.S. industrialization and global reach to new heights.  He was tragically assassinated in an attack on our Nation’s values and our success, and he should be honored for his steadfast commitment to American greatness.\nIn 1917, the country officially honored President McKinley through the naming of North America’s highest peak.  Yet after nearly a century, President Obama’s administration, in 2015, stripped the McKinley name from federal nomenclature, an affront to President McKinley’s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice.\nThis order honors President McKinley for giving his life for our great Nation and dutifully recognizes his historic legacy of protecting America’s interests and generating enormous wealth for all Americans.\n(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, reinstate the name “Mount McKinley.”  The Secretary shall subsequently update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of Mount McKinley.  The national park area surrounding Mount McKinley shall retain the name Denali National Park and Preserve.\n(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall work with Alaska Native entities and state and local organizations to adopt names for landmarks to honor the history and culture of the Alaskan people.\nSec. 4.  Gulf of America.  (a)  The area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has remained an indelible part of America.  The Gulf was a crucial artery for America’s early trade and global commerce.  It is the largest gulf in the world, and the United States coastline along this remarkable body of water spans over 1,700 miles and contains nearly 160 million acres.  Its natural resources and wildlife remain central to America’s economy today.  The bountiful geology of this basin has made it one of the most prodigious oil and gas regions in the world, providing roughly 14% of our Nation’s crude-oil production and an abundance of natural gas, and consistently driving new and innovative technologies that have allowed us to tap into some of the deepest and richest oil reservoirs in the world.  The Gulf is also home to vibrant American fisheries teeming with snapper, shrimp, grouper, stone crab, and other species, and it is recognized as one of the most productive fisheries in the world, with the second largest volume of commercial fishing landings by region in the Nation, contributing millions of dollars to local American economies.  The Gulf is also a favorite destination for American tourism and recreation activities.  Further, the Gulf is a vital region for the multi-billion-dollar U.S. maritime industry, providing some of the largest and most impressive ports in the world.  The Gulf will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping America’s future and the global economy, and in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our Nation’s economy and its people, I am directing that it officially be renamed the Gulf of America.\n(b)  As such, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, take all appropriate actions to rename as the “Gulf of America” the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba in the area formerly named as the Gulf of Mexico.  The Secretary shall subsequently update the GNIS to reflect the renaming of the Gulf and remove all references to the Gulf of Mexico from the GNIS, consistent with applicable law.  The Board shall provide guidance to ensure all federal references to the Gulf of America, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communications shall reflect its renaming.\nSec. 5.  Additional Action.  The Secretary of Interior may solicit public and intergovernmental input regarding additional patriots to honor, particularly in light of America’s semiquincentennial celebration, and shall recommend action to me, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.\nSec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025.",

and\n(iii)  infiltration into foreign governments across the Western Hemisphere.\nThe Cartels have engaged in a campaign of violence and terror throughout the Western Hemisphere that has not only destabilized countries with significant importance for our national interests but also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs.\nThe Cartels functionally control, through a campaign of assassination, terror, rape, and brute force nearly all illegal traffic across the southern border of the United States.  In certain portions of Mexico, they function as quasi-governmental entities, controlling nearly all aspects of society.  The Cartels’ activities threaten the safety of the American people, the security of the United States, and the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.  Their activities, proximity to, and incursions into the physical territory of the United States pose an unacceptable national security risk to the United States.\n(b)  Other transnational organizations, such as Tren de Aragua (TdA) and La Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) pose similar threats to the United States.  Their campaigns of violence and terror in the United States and internationally are extraordinarily violent, vicious, and similarly threaten the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.\n(c)  The Cartels and other transnational organizations, such as TdA and MS-13, operate both within and outside the United States.  They present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  I hereby declare a national emergency, under IEEPA, to deal with those threats.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to ensure the total elimination of these organizations’ presence in the United States and their ability to threaten the territory, safety, and security of the United States through their extraterritorial command-and-control structures, thereby protecting the American people and the territorial integrity of the United States.\nSec. 3.  Implementation.  (a)  Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall take all appropriate action, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, to make a recommendation regarding the designation of any cartel or other organization described in section 1 of this order as a Foreign Terrorist Organization consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189 and/or a Specially Designated Global Terrorist consistent with 50 U.S.C. 1702 and Executive Order 13224.\n(b)  Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to make operational preparations regarding the implementation of any decision I make to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. 21\net seq\n., in relation to the existence of any qualifying invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States by a qualifying actor, and to prepare such facilities as necessary to expedite the removal of those who may be designated under this order.\nSec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nEnding Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose and Policy.  The Biden Administration forced illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government, in areas ranging from airline safety to the military.  This was a concerted effort stemming from President Biden’s first day in office, when he issued Executive Order 13985, “Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.”\nPursuant to Executive Order 13985 and follow-on orders, nearly every Federal agency and entity submitted “Equity Action Plans” to detail the ways that they have furthered DEIs infiltration of the Federal Government.  The public release of these plans demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination.  That ends today.  Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great.\nSec. 2.  Implementation.  (a)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), assisted by the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), shall coordinate the termination of all discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI and “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility” (DEIA) mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities in the Federal Government, under whatever name they appear.  To carry out this directive, the Director of OPM, with the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall review and revise, as appropriate, all existing Federal employment practices, union contracts, and training policies or programs to comply with this order.  Federal employment practices, including Federal employee performance reviews, shall reward individual initiative, skills, performance, and hard work and shall not under any circumstances consider DEI or DEIA factors, goals, policies, mandates, or requirements.\n(b)  Each agency, department, or commission head, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of OMB, and the Director of OPM, as appropriate, shall take the following actions within sixty days of this order:\n(i)    terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and “environmental justice” offices and positions (including but not limited to “Chief Diversity Officer” positions); all “equity action plans,” “equity” actions, initiatives, or programs, “equity-related” grants or contracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements for employees, contractors, or grantees.\n(ii)   provide the Director of the OMB with a list of all:\n(A)  agency or department DEI, DEIA, or “environmental justice” positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures in existence on November 4, 2024, and an assessment of whether these positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures have been misleadingly relabeled in an attempt to preserve their pre-November 4, 2024 function;\n(B)  Federal contractors who have provided DEI training or DEI training materials to agency or department employees; and\n(C)  Federal grantees who received Federal funding to provide or advance DEI, DEIA, or “environmental justice” programs, services, or activities since January 20, 2021.\n(iii)  direct the deputy agency or department head to:\n(A) assess the operational impact (e.g., the number of new DEI hires) and cost of the prior administration’s DEI, DEIA, and “environmental justice” programs and policies;

  "Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth To The Federal Government": {
    "text": "Presidential Actions\nDEFENDING WOMEN FROM GENDER IDEOLOGY EXTREMISM AND RESTORING BIOLOGICAL TRUTH TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 7301 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women’s domestic abuse shelters to women’s workplace showers.  This is wrong.  Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being.  The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system.  Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself.\nThis unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts.  Invalidating the true and biological category of “woman” improperly transforms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept.\nAccordingly, my Administration will defend women’s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.\nSec. 2.  Policy and Definitions.  It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.  These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.  Under my direction, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpretation of and application of Federal law and administration policy:\n(a)  “Sex” shall refer to an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female.  “Sex” is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of “gender identity.”\n(b)  “Women” or “woman” and “girls” or “girl” shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively.\n(c)  “Men” or “man” and “boys” or “boy” shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively.\n(d)  “Female” means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell.\n(e)  “Male” means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.\n(f)  “Gender ideology” replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true.  Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex.  Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.\n(g)  “Gender identity” reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex.\nSec. 3.  Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order.\n(b)  Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes.  Each agency should therefore give the terms “sex”, “male”, “female”, “men”, “women”, “boys” and “girls” the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications.\n(c)  When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term “sex” and not “gender” in all applicable Federal policies and documents.\n(d)  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder’s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees’ sex, as defined by section 2 of this order.\n(e)  Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages.  Agency forms that require an individual’s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity.  Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology.\n(f)  The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court’s decision in\nBostock v. Clayton County\n(2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single-sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act.  This position is legally untenable and has harmed women.  The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court’s decision in\nBostock v. Clayton County\n(2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities.  In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent.\n(g)  Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.  Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\nSec. 4.  Privacy in Intimate Spaces\n.\n(a)  The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that males are not detained in women’s prisons or housed in women’s detention centers, including through amendment, as necessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n(b)  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall prepare and submit for notice and comment rulemaking a policy to rescind the final rule entitled “Equal Access in Accordance with an Individual’s Gender Identity in Community Planning and Development Programs” of September 21, 2016, 81 FR 64763, and shall submit for public comment a policy protecting women seeking single-sex rape shelters.\n(c)  The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\n(d)  Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity.\nSec. 5.  Protecting Rights.  The Attorney General shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  In accordance with that guidance, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the General Counsel and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act shall prioritize investigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified.\nSec. 6.  Bill Text.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs shall present to the President proposed bill text to codify the definitions in this order.\nSec. 7.  Agency Implementation and Reporting.  (a)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, each agency head shall submit an update on implementation of this order to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.  That update shall address:\n(i)   changes to agency documents, including regulations, guidance, forms, and communications, made to comply with this order; and\n(ii)  agency-imposed requirements on federally funded entities, including contractors, to achieve the policy of this order.\n(b)  The requirements of this order supersede conflicting provisions in any previous Executive Orders or Presidential Memoranda, including but not limited to Executive Orders 13988 of January 20, 2021, 14004 of January 25, 2021, 14020 and 14021 of March 8, 2021, and 14075 of June 15, 2022.  These Executive Orders are hereby rescinded, and the White House Gender Policy Council established by Executive Order 14020 is dissolved.\n(c)  Each agency head shall promptly rescind all guidance documents inconsistent with the requirements of this order or the Attorney General’s guidance issued pursuant to this order, or rescind such parts of such documents that are inconsistent in such manner.  Such documents include, but are not limited to:\n(i)    “The White House Toolkit on Transgender Equality”;\n(ii)   the Department of Education’s guidance documents including:\n(A)  “2024 Title IX Regulations: Pointers for Implementation” (July 2024);\n(B)  “U.S. Department of Education Toolkit: Creating Inclusive and Nondiscriminatory School Environments for LGBTQI+ Students”;\n(C)  “U.S. Department of Education Supporting LGBTQI+ Youth and Families in School” (June 21, 2023);\n(D)  “Departamento de Educación de EE.UU.  Apoyar a los jóvenes y familias LGBTQI+ en la escuela” (June 21, 2023);\n(E)  “Supporting Intersex Students: A Resource for Students, Families, and Educators” (October 2021);\n(F)  “Supporting Transgender Youth in School” (June 2021);\n(G)  “Letter to Educators on Title IX’s 49th Anniversary” (June 23, 2021);\n(H)  “Confronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools: A Resource for Students and Families” (June 2021);\n(I)  “Enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 With Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v. Clayton County” (June 22, 2021);\n(J)  “Education in a Pandemic: The Disparate Impacts of COVID-19 on America’s Students” (June 9, 2021); and\n(K)  “Back-to-School Message for Transgender Students from the U.S. Depts of Justice, Education, and HHS” (Aug. 17, 2021);\n(iii)  the Attorney General’s Memorandum of March 26, 2021 entitled “Application of\nBostock v. Clayton County\nto Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972″; and\n(iv)  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s “Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace” (April 29, 2024).\nSec. 8.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)    the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)   the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025.",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nPROTECTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGAINST INVASION\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nPROTECTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGAINST INVASION\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101\net seq\n.) and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Over the last 4 years, the prior administration invited, administered, and oversaw an unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States.  Millions of illegal aliens crossed our borders or were permitted to fly directly into the United States on commercial flights and allowed to settle in American communities, in violation of longstanding Federal laws.\nMany of these aliens unlawfully within the United States present significant threats to national security and public safety, committing vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans.  Others are engaged in hostile activities, including espionage, economic espionage, and preparations for terror-related activities.  Many have abused the generosity of the American people, and their presence in the United States has cost taxpayers billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local levels.\nEnforcing our Nation’s immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States.  The American people deserve a Federal Government that puts their interests first and a Government that understands its sacred obligation to prioritize the safety, security, and financial and economic well-being of Americans.\nThis order ensures that the Federal Government protects the American people by faithfully executing the immigration laws of the United States.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens, particularly those aliens who threaten the safety or security of the American people.  Further, it is the policy of the United States to achieve the total and efficient enforcement of those laws, including through lawful incentives and detention capabilities.\nSec. 3.  Faithful Execution of the Immigration Laws.  In furtherance of the policies described in section 2 of this order:\n(a)  Executive Order 13993 of January 20, 2021 (Revision of Civil Immigration Enforcement Policies and Priorities), Executive Order 14010 of February 2, 2021 (Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework To Address the Causes of Migration, To Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and To Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border), Executive Order 14011 of February 2, 2021 (Establishment of Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families), and Executive Order 14012 of February 2, 2021 (Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans) are hereby revoked; and\n(b)  Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate action to promptly revoke all memoranda, guidance, or other policies based on the Executive Orders revoked in section 3(a) of this order and shall employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all inadmissible and removable aliens.\nSec. 4.  Civil Enforcement Priorities.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to enable the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to set priorities for their agencies that protect the public safety and national security interests of the American people, including by ensuring the successful enforcement of final orders of removal.  Further, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that the primary mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations division is the enforcement of the provisions of the INA and other Federal laws related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States and the enforcement of the purposes of this order.\nSec. 5.  Criminal Enforcement Priorities.  The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all appropriate action to prioritize the prosecution of criminal offenses related to the unauthorized entry or continued unauthorized presence of aliens in the United States.\nSec. 6.  Federal Homeland Security Task Forces.  (a)  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to jointly establish Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTFs) in all States nationwide.\n(b)  The composition of each HSTF shall be subject to the direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, but shall include representation from any other Federal agencies with law enforcement officers, or agencies with the ability to provide logistics, intelligence, and operational support to the HSTFs, and shall also include representation from relevant State and local law enforcement agencies.  The heads of all Federal agencies shall take all appropriate action to provide support to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that the HSTFs fulfill the objectives in subsection (c) of this section, and any other lawful purpose that fulfills the policy objectives of this order.\n(c)  The objective of each HSTF is to end the presence of criminal cartels, foreign gangs, and transnational criminal organizations throughout the United States, dismantle cross-border human smuggling and trafficking networks, end the scourge of human smuggling and trafficking, with a particular focus on such offenses involving children, and ensure the use of all available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States.\n(d)  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to provide an operational command center to coordinate the activities of the HSTFs and provide such support as they may require, and shall also take all appropriate action to provide supervisory direction to their activities as may be required.\nSec. 7.  Identification of Unregistered Illegal Aliens.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to:\n(a)  Immediately announce and publicize information about the legal obligation of all previously unregistered aliens in the United States to comply with the requirements of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code;\n(b)  Ensure that all previously unregistered aliens in the United States comply with the requirements of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code;

and\n(b)  Eliminate all documentary barriers, dilatory tactics, or other restrictions that prevent the prompt repatriation of aliens to any foreign state.  Any failure or delay by a foreign state to verify the identity of a national of that state shall be considered in carrying out subsection (a) this section, and shall also be considered regarding the issuance of any other sanctions that may be available to the United States.\nSec. 14.  Visa Bonds.  The Secretary of Treasury shall take all appropriate action, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to establish a system to facilitate the administration of all bonds that the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may lawfully require to administer the provisions of the INA.\nSec. 15.  Reestablishment of the VOICE Office and Addressing Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take all appropriate and lawful action to reestablish within ICE an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens, and those victims’ family members.  The Attorney General shall also ensure that the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3771 are followed in all Federal prosecutions involving crimes committed by removable aliens.\nSec. 16.  Addressing Actions by the Previous Administration.  The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly take all appropriate action, consistent with law, to rescind the policy decisions of the previous administration that led to the increased or continued presence of illegal aliens in the United States, and align any and all departmental activities with the policies set out by this order and the immigration laws.  Such action should include, but is not limited to:\n(a)  ensuring that the parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised on only a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual alien demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from their particular continued presence in the United States arising from such parole;\n(b)  ensuring that designations of Temporary Protected Status are consistent with the provisions of section 244 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1254a), and that such designations are appropriately limited in scope and made for only so long as may be necessary to fulfill the textual requirements of that statute; and\n(c)  ensuring that employment authorization is provided in a manner consistent with section 274A of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324a), and that employment authorization is not provided to any unauthorized alien in the United States.\nSec. 17.  Sanctuary Jurisdictions.  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, to the maximum extent possible under law, evaluate and undertake any lawful actions to ensure that so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions, which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds.  Further, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall evaluate and undertake any other lawful actions, criminal or civil, that they deem warranted based on any such jurisdiction’s practices that interfere with the enforcement of Federal law.\nSec. 18.  Information Sharing.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly issue guidance to ensure maximum compliance by Department of Homeland Security personnel with the provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1373 and 8 U.S.C. 1644 and ensure that State and local governments are provided with the information necessary to fulfill law enforcement, citizenship, or immigration status verification requirements authorized by law;

Accordingly:\n(a)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and\n(b)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the failure to follow certain procedures, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements to conform with existing law and with any applicable court orders.\nSec. 23.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)  the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025.",

America, I hereby direct the following:\nAs President, my highest priority and responsibility is to ensure the safety and security of the United States and its people.  The national and homeland security threats facing the United States are complex and rapidly evolving.  These issues often do not fit neatly into the categories that single departments and agencies are designed to optimally address, a fact recognized and exploited by our strategic competitors and adversaries in their adoption of whole-of-government and even whole-of-society approaches.\nThe United States Government’s decision-making structures and processes to address national security challenges must therefore be equally adaptive and comprehensive.  They must be able to competently design and execute cooperative and integrated interagency solutions to address these\nproblems, and\nprotect and advance the national interests of the United States.  Therefore, to advise and assist me in this endeavor, I hereby direct that my system for national security policy development, decision-making, implementation, and monitoring shall be organized as set forth in this Memorandum.  This Memorandum prevails over any

  "Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects": {
    "text": "Presidential Actions\nTemporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects\nJanuary 20, 2025\nJanuary 20, 2025\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL\nTHE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR\nTHE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE\nTHE SECRETARY OF ENERGY\nTHE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\nAGENCY\nSUBJECT:                  Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer\nContinental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and\nReview of the Federal Government’s Leasing and\nPermitting Practices for Wind Projects\nSection 1.  Temporary Withdrawal of Areas.  Consistent with the principles of responsible public stewardship that are entrusted to this office, with due consideration for a variety of relevant factors, including the need to foster an energy economy capable of meeting the country’s growing demand for reliable energy, the importance of marine life, impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns, effects on energy costs for Americans –- especially those who can least afford it –- and to ensure that the United States is able to maintain a robust fishing industry for future generations and provide low cost energy to its citizens, I hereby direct as follows:\nUnder the authority granted to me in section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1341(a), I hereby withdraw from disposition for wind energy leasing all areas within the Offshore Continental Shelf (OCS) as defined in section 2 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1331.  This withdrawal shall go into effect beginning on January 21, 2025, and shall remain in effect until this Presidential Memorandum is revoked.\nTo the extent that an area is already withdrawn from disposition for wind energy leasing, the area’s withdrawal is extended for a time period beginning on January 21, 2025, until this Presidential Memorandum is revoked.\nThis withdrawal temporarily prevents consideration of any area in the OCS for any new or renewed wind energy leasing for the purposes of generation of electricity or any other such use derived from the use of wind.  This withdrawal does not apply to leasing related to any other purposes such as, but not limited to, oil, gas, minerals, and environmental conservation.\nNothing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas.  With respect to such existing leases, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Attorney General as needed, shall conduct a comprehensive review of the ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of terminating or amending any existing wind energy leases, identifying any legal bases for such removal, and submit a report with recommendations to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.\nSec. 2.  Temporary Cessation and Immediate Review of Federal Wind Leasing and Permitting Practices\n.\n(a)  In light of various alleged legal deficiencies underlying the Federal Government’s leasing and permitting of onshore and offshore wind projects, the consequences of which may lead to grave harm — including negative impacts on navigational safety interests, transportation interests, national security interests, commercial interests, and marine mammals — and in light of potential inadequacies in various environmental reviews required by the National Environmental Policy Act to lease or permit wind projects, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the heads of all other relevant agencies, shall not issue new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects pending the completion of a comprehensive assessment and review of Federal wind leasing and permitting practices.  The Secretary of the Interior shall lead that assessment and review in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The assessment shall consider the environmental impact of onshore and offshore wind projects upon wildlife, including, but not limited to, birds and marine mammals.  The assessment shall also consider the economic costs associated with the intermittent generation of electricity and the effect of subsidies on the viability of the wind industry.\n(b)  In light of criticism that the Record of Decision (ROD) issued by the Bureau of Land Management on December 5, 2024, with respect to the Lava Ridge Wind Project Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), as approved by the Department of the Interior, is allegedly contrary to the public interest and suffers from legal deficiencies, the Secretary of the Interior shall, as appropriate, place a temporary moratorium on all activities and rights of Magic Valley Energy, LLC, or any other party under the ROD, including, but not limited to, any rights-of-way or rights of development or operation of any projects contemplated in the ROD.  The Secretary of the Interior shall review the ROD and, as appropriate, conduct a new, comprehensive analysis of the various interests implicated by the Lava Ridge Wind Project and the potential environmental impacts.\n(c)  The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall assess the environmental impact and cost to surrounding communities of defunct and idle windmills and deliver a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, with their findings and recommended authorities to require the removal of such windmills.\n(d)  The Attorney General may, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, provide notice of this order to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation related to any aspect of the Federal leasing or permitting of onshore or offshore wind projects or the Lava Ridge Wind Project, and may, in the Attorney General’s discretion, request that the court stay the litigation or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the completion of the actions described in subsection (a) or subsection (b) of this section, as applicable.\nThis memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\nThis memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the\nFederal Register.",

  "Declaring a National Energy Emergency": {
    "text": "Presidential Actions\nDECLARING A NATIONAL ENERGY EMERGENCY\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601\net seq.\n) (“NEA”), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.\nPurpose\n.\nThe energy and critical minerals (“energy”) identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs.  We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.  Caused by the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration, our Nation’s inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans, particularly those living on low- and fixed-incomes.\nThis active threat to the American people from high energy prices is exacerbated by our Nation’s diminished capacity to insulate itself from hostile foreign actors.  Energy security is an increasingly crucial theater of global competition.  In an effort to harm the American people, hostile state and non-state foreign actors have targeted our domestic energy infrastructure, weaponized our reliance on foreign energy, and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within international commodity markets.  An affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy is a fundamental requirement for the national and economic security of any nation.\nThe integrity and expansion of our Nation’s energy infrastructure —- from coast to coast -— is an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States’ national and economic security.  It is imperative that the Federal government puts the physical and economic wellbeing of the American people first.\nMoreover, the United States has the potential to use its unrealized energy resources domestically, and to sell to international allies and partners a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy.  This would create jobs and economic prosperity for Americans forgotten in the present economy, improve the United States’ trade balance, help our country compete with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and partners, and support international peace and security.  Accordingly, our Nation’s dangerous energy situation inflicts unnecessary and perilous constraints on our foreign policy.\nThe policies of the previous administration have driven our Nation into a national emergency, where a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply, and an increasingly unreliable grid, require swift and decisive action.  Without immediate remedy, this situation will dramatically deteriorate in the near future due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology.  The United States’ ability to remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy and the integrity of our Nation’s electrical grid.  Our Nation’s current inadequate development of domestic energy resources leaves us vulnerable to hostile foreign actors and poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States’ prosperity and national security.\nThese numerous problems are most pronounced in our Nation’s Northeast and West Coast, where dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population.  The United States’ insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation’s economy, national security, and foreign policy.  In light of these findings, I hereby declare a national emergency.\nSec. 2. Emergency Approvals\n.\n(a)  The heads of executive departments and agencies (“agencies”) shall identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well as all other lawful authorities they may possess, to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands.  If an agency assesses that use of either Federal eminent domain authorities or authorities afforded under the Defense Production Act (Public Law 81-774, 50 U.S.C. 4501\net seq\n.) are necessary to achieve this objective, the agency shall submit recommendations for a course of action to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.\n(b)  Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)(ii)(III), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, after consultation with, and concurrence by, the Secretary of Energy, shall consider issuing emergency fuel waivers to allow the year-round sale of E15 gasoline to meet any projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of gasoline across the Nation.\nSec. 3. Expediting the Delivery of Energy Infrastructure\n.\n(a)\nTo facilitate the Nation’s energy supply, agencies shall identify and use all relevant lawful emergency and other authorities available to them to expedite the completion of all authorized and appropriated infrastructure, energy, environmental, and natural resources projects that are within the identified authority of each of the Secretaries to perform or to advance.\n(b)  To protect the collective national and economic security of the United States, agencies shall identify and use all lawful emergency or other authorities available to them to facilitate the supply, refining, and transportation of energy in and through the West Coast of the United States, Northeast of the United States, and Alaska.\n(c)  The Secretaries shall provide such reports regarding activities under this section as may be requested by the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.\nSec. 4.\nEmergency Regulations and Nationwide Permits Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Other Statutes Administered by the Army Corps of Engineers\n.\n(a)  Within 30 days from the date of this order, the heads of all agencies, as well as the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works shall:\n(i)   identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply that may be subject to emergency treatment pursuant to the regulations and nationwide permits promulgated by the Corps, or jointly by the Corps and EPA, pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, 33 U.S.C. 403, and section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1413 (collectively, the “emergency Army Corps permitting provisions”); and\n(ii)  shall provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”); the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).  Such\nreport\nmay be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.\n(b)  Agencies are directed to use, to the fullest extent possible and consistent with applicable law, the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply.\n(c)  Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, each department and agency shall provide a status report to the OMB Director; the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Director of the National Economic Council; and the Chairman of the CEQ. Each such report shall list actions taken within subsection (a)(i) of this section, shall list the status of any previously reported planned or potential actions, and shall list any new planned or potential actions that fall within subsection (a)(i).  Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.\n(d)  The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, shall be available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other prompt and appropriate action concerning the application of the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions.  The Administrator of the EPA shall provide prompt cooperation to the Secretary of the Army and to agencies in connection with the discharge of the responsibilities described in this section.\nSec. 5\n.\nEndangered Species Act (ESA) Emergency Consultation Regulations\n.\n(a)  No later than 30 days from the date of this order, the heads of all agencies tasked in this order shall:\n(i)   identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply that may be subject to the regulation on consultations in emergencies, 50 C.F.R. 402.05, promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; and\n(ii)  provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the OMB Director, the Director of the National Economic Council, and the Chairman of CEQ.  Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.\n(b)  Agencies are directed to use, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, the ESA regulation on consultations in emergencies, to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply.\n(c)  Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, the head of each agency shall provide a status report to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the OMB Director, the Director of the National Economic Council, and the Chairman of CEQ. Each such report shall list actions taken within the categories described in subsection (a)(i) of this section, the status of any previously reported planned or potential actions, and any new planned or potential actions within these categories.  Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.  The OMB Director may grant discretionary exemptions from this reporting requirement.\n(d)  The Secretary of the Interior shall ensure that the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, or the Director’s authorized representative, is available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other prompt and appropriate action concerning the application of the ESA’s emergency regulations.  The Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries for the National Marine Fisheries Service, or the Assistant Administrator’s authorized representative, is available for such consultation and to take such other action.\nSec. 6. Convening the Endangered Species Act Committee.  (a)  In acting as Chairman of the Endangered Species Act Committee, the Secretary of the Interior shall convene the Endangered Species Act Committee not less than quarterly, unless otherwise required by law, to review and consider any lawful applications submitted by an agency, the Governor of a State, or any applicant for a permit or license who submits for exemption from obligations imposed by Section 7 of the ESA.\n(b)  To the extent practicable under the law, the Secretary of the Interior shall ensure a prompt and efficient review of all submissions described in subsection (a) of this section, to include identification of any legal deficiencies, in order to ensure an initial determination within 20 days of receipt and the ability to convene the Endangered Species Act Committee to resolve the submission within 140 days of such initial determination of eligibility.\n(c)  In the event that the committee has no pending applications for review, the committee or its designees shall nonetheless convene to identify obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure specifically deriving from implementation of the ESA or the Marine Mammal Protection Act, to include regulatory reform efforts, species listings, and other related matters with the aim of developing procedural, regulatory, and interagency improvements.\nSec. 7. Coordinated Infrastructure Assistance\n.\n(a)  In collaboration with the Secretaries of Interior and Energy, the Secretary of Defense shall conduct an assessment of the Department of Defense’s ability to acquire and transport the energy, electricity, or fuels needed to protect the homeland and to conduct operations abroad, and, within 60 days, shall submit this assessment to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.  This assessment shall identify specific vulnerabilities, including, but not limited to, potentially insufficient transportation and refining infrastructure across the Nation, with a focus on such vulnerabilities within the Northeast and West Coast regions of the United States.  The assessment shall also identify and recommend the requisite authorities and resources to remedy such vulnerabilities, consistent with applicable law.\n(b)  In accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, to address any vulnerabilities identified in the assessment mandated by subsection (a).  Any such recommended actions shall be submitted to the President for review, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.\nSec. 8\n.\nDefinitions\n.\nFor purposes of this order, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)  The term “energy” or “energy resources” means crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of flowing water, and critical minerals, as defined by 30 U.S.C. 1606 (a)(3).\n(b)  The term “production” means the extraction or creation of energy.\n(c)  The term “transportation” means the physical movement of energy, including through, but not limited to, pipelines.\n(d)  The term “refining” means the physical or chemical change of energy into a form that can be used by consumers or users, including, but not limited to, the creation of gasoline, diesel, ethanol, aviation fuel, or the beneficiation, enrichment, or purification of minerals.\n(e)  The term “generation” means the use of energy to produce electricity or thermal power and the transmission of electricity from its site of generation.\n(f)  The term “energy supply” means the production, transportation, refining, and generation of energy.\nSec. 9.

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nRESTORING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CAREER SENIOR EXECUTIVES\nJanuary 20, 2025\nJanuary 20, 2025\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES\nSUBJECT:       Restoring Accountability for Career Senior\nExecutives\nCareer Senior Executive Service (SES) officials are charged to “ensure that the executive management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality,” as required by section 3131 of title 5, United States Code.  SES officials have enormous influence over the functioning of the Federal Government, and thus the well-being of hundreds of millions of Americans.\nAs the Constitution makes clear, and as the Supreme Court of the United States has reaffirmed, “the ‘executive Power’ — all of it — is ‘vested in a President,’ who must ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’”\nSeila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n, 591 U.S. 197, 203 (2020).  “Because no single person could fulfill that responsibility alone, the Framers expected that the President would rely on subordinate officers for assistance.”\nId.\nat 203–04.\nThe President’s power to remove subordinates is a core part of the Executive power vested by Article II of the Constitution and is necessary for the President to perform his duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  Because SES officials wield significant governmental authority, they must serve at the pleasure of the President.\nOnly that chain of responsibility ensures that SES officials are properly accountable to the President and the American people.  If career SES officials fail to faithfully fulfill their duties to advance the needs, policies, and goals of the United States, the President must be able to rectify the situation and ensure that the entire Executive Branch faithfully executes the law.  For instance, SES officials who engage in unauthorized disclosure of Executive Branch deliberations, violate the constitutional rights of Americans, refuse to implement policy priorities, or perform their duties inefficiently or negligently should be held accountable.\nThe President must be able to trust that the Executive Branch will work together in service of the Nation.  My Administration will restore a “government of the people, by the people, for the people.”  Therefore:\n(a)  Within 30 days of the signing of this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall issue SES Performance Plans that agencies must adopt;\n(b)  Agency heads, who along with their senior staff manage career SES officials as one of their core functions, shall use all available authorities to reinvigorate the SES system and prioritize accountability;\n(c)  Each agency head shall, as necessary and appropriate and consistent with the procedural requirements of section 3395 of title 5, United States Code, reassign agency SES members to ensure their knowledge, skills, abilities, and mission assignments are optimally aligned to implement my agenda;\n(d)  Each agency head should terminate its existing Executive Resources Board (ERB), institute a new or interim ERB, and assign senior noncareer officials to chair and serve on the board as a majority alongside career members;\n(e)  Each agency head should terminate its existing Performance Review Board membership and re-constitute membership with individuals committed to full enforcement of SES performance evaluations that promote and assure an SES of the highest caliber; and\n(f)  Any agency head who becomes aware of an SES official whose performance or continued occupancy of the position is inconsistent with either the principles reaffirmed in this Order or their duties to the Nation under section 3131 of title 5, United States Code, shall immediately take all appropriate actions, up to and including removal of that official, with the support of OPM and OMB.  Restoring an accountable government workforce is a top priority of my Administration.",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nRESTORING THE DEATH PENALTY AND PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Capital punishment is an essential tool for deterring and punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes and acts of lethal violence against American citizens.  Before, during, and after the founding of the United States, our cities, States, and country have continuously relied upon capital punishment as the ultimate deterrent and only proper punishment for the vilest crimes.  Our Founders knew well that only capital punishment can bring justice and restore order in response to such evil.  For this and other reasons, capital punishment continues to enjoy broad popular support.\nYet for too long, politicians and judges who oppose capital punishment have defied and subverted the laws of our country.  At every turn, they seek to thwart the execution of lawfully imposed capital sentences and choose to enforce their personal beliefs rather than the law.  When President Biden took office in 2021, he allowed his Department of Justice to issue a moratorium on Federal executions, in defiance of his duty to faithfully execute the laws of the United States that provide for capital punishment.  And on December 23, 2024, President Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 most vile and sadistic rapists, child molesters, and murderers on Federal death row:  remorseless criminals who brutalized young children, strangled and drowned their victims, and hunted strangers for sport.  He commuted their sentences even though the laws of our Nation have always protected victims by applying capital punishment to barbaric acts like theirs.  Judges who oppose capital punishment have likewise disregarded the law by falsely claiming that capital punishment is unconstitutional, even though the Constitution explicitly acknowledges the legality of capital punishment.\nThese efforts to subvert and undermine capital punishment defy the laws of our nation, make a mockery of justice, and insult the victims of these horrible crimes.  The Government’s most solemn responsibility is to protect its citizens from abhorrent acts, and my Administration will not tolerate efforts to stymie and eviscerate the laws that authorize capital punishment against those who commit horrible acts of violence against American citizens.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to ensure that the laws that authorize capital punishment are respected and faithfully implemented, and to counteract the politicians and judges who subvert the law by obstructing and preventing the execution of capital sentences.\nSec. 3.  Federal Capital Punishment.  (a)  The Attorney General shall pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use.\n(b) In addition to pursuing the death penalty where possible, the Attorney General shall, where consistent with applicable law, pursue Federal jurisdiction and seek the death penalty regardless of other factors for every federal capital crime involving:\n(i)   The murder of a law-enforcement officer; or\n(ii)  A capital crime committed by an alien illegally present in this country.\nThe Attorney General shall encourage State attorneys general and district attorneys to bring State capital charges for all capital crimes with special attention to the crimes described in Subsections (i) and (ii), regardless of whether the federal trial results in a capital sentence.\n(d)  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to modify the Justice Manual based on the policy and purpose set forth in this Executive Order.\n(e)  The Attorney General shall evaluate the places of imprisonment and conditions of confinement for each of the 37 murderers whose Federal death sentences were commuted by President Biden, and the Attorney General shall take all lawful and appropriate action to ensure that these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.  The Attorney General shall further evaluate whether these offenders can be charged with State capital crimes and shall recommend appropriate action to state and local authorities.\nSec. 4.  Preserving Capital Punishment in the States.  (a)  The Attorney General shall take all necessary and lawful action to ensure that each state that allows capital punishment has a sufficient supply of drugs needed to carry out lethal injection.\n(b) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to approve or deny any pending request for certification made by any State under 28 U.S.C. 2265.\nSec. 5.  Seeking The Overruling of Supreme Court Precedents That Hinder Capital Punishment.  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to seek the overruling of Supreme Court precedents that limit the authority of State and Federal governments to impose capital punishment.\nSec. 6.  Prosecuting Crime to Protect Communities.  (a)  The Attorney General shall appropriately prioritize public safety and the prosecution of violent crime, and take all appropriate action necessary to dismantle transnational criminal activity in the United States.\n(b)  To ensure the fullest protection of American communities from violence, the Attorney General shall encourage state attorneys general and district attorneys to adopt policies and practices aligned with subsection (a).  Federal law enforcement should coordinate with State and local law enforcement where possible to facilitate these objectives.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025.",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nPROTECTING THE MEANING AND VALUE OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  The privilege of United States citizenship is a priceless and profound gift.  The Fourteenth Amendment states:  “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”  That provision rightly repudiated the Supreme Court of the United States’s shameful decision in\nDred Scott v. Sandford\n, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), which misinterpreted the Constitution as permanently excluding people of African descent from eligibility for United States citizenship solely based on their race.\nBut the Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.  The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”  Consistent with this understanding, the Congress has further specified through legislation that “a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” is a national and citizen of the United States at birth, 8 U.S.C. 1401, generally mirroring the Fourteenth Amendment’s text.\nAmong the categories of individuals born in the United States and not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the United States:  (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States that no department or agency of the United States government shall issue documents recognizing United States citizenship, or accept documents issued by State, local, or other governments or authorities purporting to recognize United States citizenship, to persons:  (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the person’s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person’s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.\n(b)  Subsection (a) of this section shall apply only to persons who are born within the United States after 30 days from the date of this order.\n(c)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect the entitlement of other individuals, including children of lawful permanent residents, to obtain documentation of their United States citizenship.\nSec. 3.  Enforcement.  (a)  The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the regulations and policies of their respective departments and agencies are consistent with this order, and that no officers, employees, or agents of their respective departments and agencies act, or forbear from acting, in any manner inconsistent with this order.\n(b)  The heads of all executive departments and agencies shall issue public guidance within 30 days of the date of this order regarding this order’s implementation with respect to their operations and activities.\nSec. 4.  Definitions.  As used in this order:\n(a)  “Mother” means the immediate female biological progenitor.\n(b)  “Father” means the immediate male biological progenitor.\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025.",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nREALIGNING THE UNITED STATES REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nREALIGNING THE United States REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101\net seq.\n, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Over the last 4 years, the United States has been inundated with record levels of migration, including through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).  Cities and small towns alike, from Charleroi, Pennsylvania, and Springfield, Ohio, to Whitewater, Wisconsin, have seen significant influxes of migrants.  Even major urban centers such as New York City, Chicago, and Denver have sought Federal aid to manage the burden of new arrivals.  Some jurisdictions, like New York and Massachusetts, have even recently declared states of emergency because of increased migration.\nThe United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.  This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to ensure that public safety and national security are paramount considerations in the administration of the USRAP, and to admit only those refugees who can fully and appropriately assimilate into the United States and to ensure that the United States preserves taxpayer resources for its citizens.  It is also the policy of the United States that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees.\nSec. 3.  Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.  (a)  I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  I therefore direct that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP be suspended — subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (c) of this section — until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order.  This suspension shall take effect at 12:01 am eastern standard time on January 27, 2025.\n(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order.\n(c)  Notwithstanding the suspension of the USRAP imposed pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit aliens to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such aliens as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States.\n(d)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.  In all cases, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure that the State and local consultation requirements in 8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(2) are carried out with respect to all refugees admitted to the United States.\nSec. 4.  Resumption of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.  Within 90 days of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit a report to the President through the Homeland Security Advisor regarding whether resumption of entry of refugees into the United States under the USRAP would be in the interests of the United States, in light of the policies outlined in section 2 of this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit further reports every 90 days thereafter until I determine that resumption of the USRAP is in the interests of the United States.\nSec. 5.  Revocation.  Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs To Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration), is hereby revoked.\nSec. 6.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to,

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nUNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Background\n.\nAmerica is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nation’s economic prosperity.  In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of these resources, limited the generation of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens.  These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security.\nIt is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources.  This will restore American prosperity —- including for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years.  It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength.\nSec. 2.  Policy.\nIt is the policy of the United States:\n(a)  to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the needs of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future;\n(b)  to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states;\n(c)  to protect the United States’s economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation;\n(d)  to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded in clearly applicable law;\n(e)  to eliminate the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate” and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable;\n(f)  to safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries;\n(g)  to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action shall, whenever evaluated, be reported separately from its domestic costs and benefits, in order to promote sound regulatory decision making and prioritize the interests of the American people;\n(h)  to guarantee that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis; and\n(i)  to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary to the principles outlined in this section, unless required by law.\nSec. 3.  Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden the Development of Domestic Energy Resources.  (a)  The heads of all agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agency actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources — with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources — or that are otherwise inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restrictions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances.\n(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law.  The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section.\n(c)  Agencies shall promptly notify the Attorney General of any steps taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section so that the Attorney General may, as appropriate:\n(i)   provide notice of this Executive Order and any such actions to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation in which such actions may be relevant; and\n(ii)  request that such court stay or otherwise delay further litigation, or seek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the completion of the administrative actions described in this order.\n(d)  Pursuant to the policy outlined in section 2 of this order, the Attorney General shall consider whether pending litigation against illegal, dangerous, or harmful policies should be resolved through stays or other relief.\nSec. 4.  Revocation of and Revisions to Certain Presidential and Regulatory Actions\n.\n(a)  The following are revoked and any offices established therein are abolished:\n(i)     Executive Order 13990 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis);\n(ii)    Executive Order 13992 of January 20, 2021 (Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation);\n(iii)   Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad);\n(iv)    Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology);\n(v)     Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration);\n(vi)    Executive Order 14027 of May 7, 2021 (Establishment of the Climate Change Support Office);\n(vii)   Executive Order 14030 of May 20, 2021 (Climate-Related Financial Risk);\n(viii)  Executive Order 14037 of August 5, 2021 (Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars and Trucks);\n(ix)    Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability);\n(x)     Executive Order 14072 of April 22, 2022 (Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies);\n(xi)    Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022); and\n(xii)   Executive Order 14096 of April 21, 2023 (Revitalizing Our Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All).\n(b)  All activities, programs, and operations associated with the American Climate Corps, including actions taken by any agency shall be terminated immediately.  Within one day of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a letter to all parties to the “American Climate Corps Memorandum of Understanding” dated December 2023 to terminate the memorandum, and the head of each party to the memorandum shall agree to the termination in writing.\n(c)  Any assets, funds, or resources allocated to an entity or program abolished by subsection (a) of this section shall be redirected or disposed of in accordance with applicable law.\n(d)  The head of any agency that has taken action respecting offices and programs in subsection (a) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all such actions are terminated or, if necessary, appropriate, or required by law, that such activities are transitioned to other agencies or entities.\n(e)  Any contract or agreement between the United States and any third party on behalf of the entities or programs abolished in subsection (a) of this section, or in furtherance of them, shall be terminated for convenience, or otherwise, as quickly as permissible under the law.\nSec. 5.  Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting.  (a)  Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement of environmental quality) is hereby revoked.\n(b)  To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321\net seq.\n, and propose rescinding CEQ’s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500\net seq.\n(c)  Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall convene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level implementing regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-5).  Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process.\n(d)\nThe Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule.  For any project an agency head deems essential for the Nation’s economy or national security, agencies shall use all possible authorities, including emergency authorities, to expedite the adjudication of Federal permits.  Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects.\n(e)  The Director of the NEC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs shall jointly prepare recommendations to Congress, which shall:\n(i)   facilitate the permitting and construction of interstate energy transportation and other critical energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pipelines, particularly in regions of the Nation that have lacked such development in recent years; and\n(ii)  provide greater certainty in the Federal permitting process, including, but not limited to, streamlining the judicial review of the application of NEPA.\nSec. 6.  Prioritizing Accuracy in Environmental Analyses.  (a)  In all Federal permitting adjudications or regulatory processes, all agencies shall adhere to only the relevant legislated requirements for environmental considerations and any considerations beyond these requirements are eliminated.  In fulfilling all such requirements, agencies shall strictly use the most robust methodologies of assessment at their disposal and shall not use methodologies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated.\n(b) The Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which was established pursuant to Executive Order 13990, is hereby disbanded, and any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy including:\n(i)    the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking);\n(ii)   the Report of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Interagency Working Group of November 2023 (National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System);\n(iii)  the Technical Support Document of February 2021 (Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990); and\n(iv)   estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases, including the estimates for the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, or the social cost of nitrous oxide based, in whole or in part, on the IWG’s work or guidance.\n(c)  The calculation of the “social cost of carbon” is marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation.  Its abuse arbitrarily slows regulatory decisions and, by rendering the United States economy internationally uncompetitive, encourages a greater human impact on the environment by affording less efficient foreign energy producers a greater share of the global energy and natural resource market.  Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA shall issue guidance to address these harmful and detrimental inadequacies, including consideration of eliminating the “social cost of carbon” calculation from any Federal permitting or regulatory decision.\n(d)  Prior to the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, agencies shall ensure estimates to assess the value of changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from agency actions, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international effects and evaluating appropriate discount rates, are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A-4 of September 17, 2003 (Regulatory Analysis).\n(e)  Furthermore, the head of each agency shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, initiate a process to make such changes to any rule, regulation, policy or action as may be necessary to ensure consistency with the Regulatory Analysis.\n(f)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA, in collaboration with the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit joint recommendations to the Director of OMB on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator’s findings, “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,” Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009).\nSec. 7.  Terminating the Green New Deal.\n(a)  All agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and shall review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agency heads shall submit a report to the Director of the NEC and Director of OMB that details the findings of this review, including recommendations to enhance their alignment with the policy set forth in section 2.  No funds identified in this subsection (a) shall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt.\n(b)  When procuring goods and services, making decisions about leases, and making other arrangements that result in disbursements of Federal funds, agencies shall prioritize cost-effectiveness, American workers and businesses, and the sensible use of taxpayer money, to the greatest extent.  The Director of OMB shall finalize and circulate guidelines to further implement this subsection.\n(c)  All agencies shall assess whether enforcement discretion of authorities and regulations can be utilized to advance the policy outlined in section 2 of this order.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB identifying any such instances.\nSec. 8.\nProtecting America’s National Security.(a) The Secretary of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible, consistent with applicable law.  In assessing the “Public Interest” to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application.\n(b)  With respect to any proposed deepwater port for the export of liquefied natural gas (project) for which a favorable record of decision (ROD) has previously been issued pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), 33 U.S.C. 1501\net seq.\n, the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall, within 30 days of the date of this order and consistent with applicable law, determine whether any refinements to the project proposed subsequent to the ROD are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that substantially differ from those associated with the originally-evaluated project so as to present a seriously different picture of the foreseeable adverse environmental consequences (seriously different consequences).  In making this determination, MARAD shall qualitatively assess any difference in adverse environmental consequences between the project with and without the proposed refinements, including any potential consequences not addressed in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which shall be considered adequate under NEPA notwithstanding any revisions to NEPA that may have been enacted following the final EIS.  MARAD shall submit this determination, together with a detailed justification, to the Secretary of Transportation and to the President.\n(c)  Pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, if MARAD determines that such refinements are not likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall include in that determination a description of the refinements to supplement and update the ROD, if necessary and then no later than 30 additional days, he shall issue a DWPA license.\n(d)  If MARAD determines, with concurrence from the Secretary of Transportation, that such proposed refinements are likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall, within 60 days after submitting such determination, issue an Environmental Assessment (EA) examining such consequences and, with respect to all other environmental consequences not changed due to project refinements, shall reaffirm the conclusions of the final EIS.  Within 30 days after issuing the EA, MARAD shall issue an addendum to the

ECONOMIC\nPOLICY\nTHE SENIOR COUNSELOR FOR TRADE AND MANUFACTURING\nSUBJECT:                  America First Trade Policy\nSection 1.  Background.  In 2017, my Administration pursued trade and economic policies that put the American economy, the American worker, and our national security first.  This spurred an American revitalization marked by stable supply chains, massive economic growth, historically low inflation, a substantial increase in real wages and\nreal median\nhousehold wealth, and a path toward eliminating destructive trade deficits.\nMy Administration treated trade policy as a critical component to national security and reduced our Nation’s dependence on other countries to meet our key security needs.\nAmericans benefit from and deserve an America First trade policy\n.\nTherefore, I am establishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our Nation’s industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and —\nabove all\n— benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses\n.\nSec. 2.  Addressing Unfair and Unbalanced Trade\n.\n(a)  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative, shall investigate the causes of our country’s large and persistent annual trade deficits in goods, as well as the economic and national security implications and risks resulting from such deficits, and recommend appropriate measures, such as a global supplemental tariff or other policies, to remedy such deficits.\n(b)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall

effective balance of payments adjustments or that provides trading partners with an unfair competitive advantage in international trade, and shall identify any countries that he believes should be designated as currency manipulators.\n(f)  The United States Trade Representative shall review existing United States trade agreements and sectoral trade agreements and recommend any revisions that may be necessary or appropriate to achieve or maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to free trade agreement partner countries\n.\n(g)  The United

Secretary of Commerce shall review procedures for conducting verifications pursuant to section\n1677m of\ntitle 19, United States Code, and assess whether these procedures sufficiently induce compliance by foreign respondents and governments involved in AD/CVD proceedings.  The Secretary of Commerce shall consider modifications to these procedures, as appropriate.\n(i)  The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall assess the loss of tariff revenues and the risks from importing counterfeit products and contraband drugs, e.g., fentanyl, that each result from the current implementation of the $800 or less,

health by preventing unlawful importations.\n(j)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, shall investigate whether any foreign country subjects United States citizens or corporations to discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes\npursuant to\nsection 891 of title 26, United States Code.\n(k)  The United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, shall review the impact of all trade agreements — including the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government

practices identified in such review — and he shall recommend such actions as are necessary to remediate any issues identified in connection with this process.\n(c)  The United States Trade Representative shall investigate other acts, policies, and practices by the PRC that may be unreasonable or discriminatory and that may burden or restrict United States commerce, and shall make

Hundreds of thousands of Americans have tragically died from drug overdoses because of the illicit narcotics that have flowed across the southern border.\nThis assault on the American people and the integrity of America’s sovereign borders represents a grave threat to our Nation.\nBecause of the gravity and emergency of this present danger and imminent threat, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to take all appropriate action to assist the Department of Homeland Security in obtaining full operational control of the southern border.\nTo protect the security and safety of United States citizens, to protect each of the States against invasion, and to uphold my duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, it is my responsibility as President to ensure that the illegal entry of aliens into the United States via the southern border be immediately and entirely stopped.\nAs Commander in Chief, I have no more solemn duty than to protect the American people.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601\net seq\n.), hereby declare that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States, and that section 12302 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretaries of the military departments concerned, subject to the direction of the Secretary of Defense.  To provide additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal Government’s response to the emergency at the southern border, I hereby declare that this emergency requires use of the Armed Forces and, in accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), that the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of Defense and, at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, to the Secretaries of the military departments.  I hereby direct as follows:\nSection 1.  Deployment of Personnel and Resources.  The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of each relevant military department, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall order as many units or members of the Armed Forces, including the Ready Reserve and the National Guard, as the Secretary of Defense determines to be appropriate to support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control of the southern border of the United States.  The Secretary of Defense shall further take all appropriate action to facilitate the operational needs of the Secretary of Homeland Security along the southern border, including through the provision of appropriate detention space, transportation (including aircraft), and other logistics services in support of civilian-controlled law enforcement operations.\nSec. 2.  Additional Physical Barriers.  The Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security shall immediately take all appropriate action, consistent with law, including 10 U.S.C. 2214, to construct additional physical barriers along the southern border.  To the extent possible, the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security shall coordinate with any Governor of a State that is willing to assist with the deployment of any physical infrastructure to improve operational security at the southern border.\nSec. 3.  Unmanned Aerial Systems.  The Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission shall, consistent with applicable law, consider waiving all applicable Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communications Commission regulations or policies, respectively, that restrict the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to counter unmanned aerial systems within 5 miles of the southern border.\nSec. 4.  Revision of Policies and Strategies.  The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action, consistent with law, to prioritize the impedance and denial of the unauthorized physical entry of aliens across the southern border of the United States, and to ensure that use of force policies prioritize the safety and security of Department of Homeland Security personnel and of members of the Armed Forces.\nSec. 5.  Revocation.  Proclamation 10142 of January 20, 2021 (Termination of Emergency With Respect to the Southern Border of the United States and Redirection of Funds Diverted to Border Wall Construction), is hereby revoked.\nSec. 6.  Reporting Requirement.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of this proclamation, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the President, through the Homeland Security Advisor, a report outlining all actions taken to fulfill the requirements and objectives of this proclamation;

  "Holding Former Government Officials Accountable For Election Interference And Improper Disclosure Of Sensitive Governmental Information": {
    "text": "Presidential Actions\nHOLDING FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE\nFOR ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND IMPROPER DISCLOSURE\nOF SENSITIVE GOVERNMENTAL INFORMATION\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  In the closing weeks of the 2020 Presidential campaign, at least 51 former intelligence officials coordinated with the Biden campaign to issue a letter discrediting the reporting that President Joseph R. Biden’s son had abandoned his laptop at a computer repair business.  Signatories of the letter falsely suggested that the news story was part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\nBefore being issued, the letter was sent to the CIA Prepublication Classification Review Board, the body typically assigned to formally evaluate the sensitive nature of documents prior to publication.  Senior CIA officials were made aware of the contents of the letter, and multiple signatories held clearances at the time and maintained ongoing contractual relationships with the CIA.\nFederal policymakers must be able to rely on analysis conducted by the Intelligence Community and be confident that it is accurate, crafted with professionalism, and free from politically motivated engineering to affect political outcomes in the United States.  The signatories willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions.  This fabrication of the imprimatur of the Intelligence Community to suppress information essential to the American people during a Presidential election is an egregious breach of trust reminiscent of a third world country.  And now the faith of Americans in all other patriotic intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect the Nation has been imperiled.\nNational security is also damaged by the publication of classified information.  Former National Security Advisor John R. Bolton published a memoir for monetary gain after he was terminated from his White House position in 2019.  The book was rife with sensitive information drawn from his time in government.  The memoir’s reckless treatment of sensitive information undermined the ability of future presidents to request and obtain candid advice on matters of national security from their staff.  Publication also created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed.\nTo remedy these abuses of the public trust, this Order directs the revocation of any active or current security clearances held by:  (i) the former intelligence officials who engaged in misleading and inappropriate political coordination with the 2020 Biden presidential campaign; and (ii) John R.

  "Restoring Accountability To Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce": {
    "text": "Presidential Actions\nRESTORING ACCOUNTABILITY TO POLICY-INFLUENCING\nPOSITIONS WITHIN THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301, 3302, and 7511 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1.  Purpose.  Article II of the United States Constitution vests the President with the sole and exclusive authority over the executive branch, including the authority to manage the Federal workforce to ensure effective execution of Federal law.  A critical aspect of this executive function is the responsibility to maintain professionalism and accountability within the civil service.  This accountability is sorely lacking today.  Only 41 percent of civil service supervisors are confident that they can remove an employee who engaged in insubordination or serious misconduct.  Even fewer supervisors –- 26 percent — are confident that they can remove an employee for poor performance.\nAccountability is essential for all Federal employees, but it is especially important for those who are in policy-influencing positions.  These personnel are entrusted to shape and implement actions that have a significant impact on all Americans.  Any power they have is delegated by the President, and they must be accountable to the President, who is the only member of the executive branch, other than the Vice President, elected and directly accountable to the American people.  In recent years, however, there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career Federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.  Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\nSec. 2.  Reinstatement of Prior Administration Policy.  Executive Order 13957 of October 21, 2020 (Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service), is hereby immediately reinstated with full force and effect, subject to the amendments described in section 3 of this order; provided that the date of this order shall be treated as the date of Executive Order 13957.\nSec. 3.  Amendments to Prior Administration Policy.  Executive Order 13957 is amended as follows:\n(a)  replace the letter “F” throughout, when used to designate an excepted service schedule, with the words “Policy/Career”;\n(b)  in section 1:\n(i)   remove the text between the words “make necessary” in the seventh paragraph and “excepting such positions” in the eighth paragraph; and\n(ii)  insert the text “competitive service and the” immediately before the words “adverse action procedures” in the eighth paragraph;\n(c)  in section 4(a)(i), replace the word “Positions” with the words “Career positions” in the final paragraph;\n(d)  in section 4(b)(i), add the text “providing for the application of Civil Service Rule 6.3(a) to Schedule Policy/Career positions and” after the words “as appropriate”;\n(e)  in section 5:\n(i)   insert the words “recommend that the President” immediately after the words “petition the Director to” in subsection (a)(i);\n(ii)  insert the following text at the end of subsection (c):\n“(vi)  directly or indirectly supervising employees in Schedule Policy/Career positions; or\n(vii)  duties that the Director otherwise indicates may be appropriate for inclusion in Schedule Policy/Career.”; and\n(iii)  amend subsection (d) to read “The Director shall promptly recommend to the President which positions should be placed in Schedule Policy/Career.”;\n(f)  in section 6:\n(i)   designate the existing text as new subsection\n“(a)”;\n(ii)  insert a new subsection (b) that reads:\n“(b)  Employees in or applicants for Schedule Policy/Career positions are not required to personally or politically support the current President or the policies of the current administration. They are required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the President.  Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal.”\nSec. 4.  Conforming Regulatory Changes.  The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (Director) shall promptly amend the Civil Service Regulations to rescind all changes made by the final rule of April 9, 2024, “Upholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles,” 89\nFed. Reg.\n24982, that impede the purposes of or would otherwise affect the implementation of Executive Order 13957.  Until such rescissions are effectuated (including the resolution of any judicial review), 5 CFR part 302, subpart F, 5 CFR 210.102(b)(3), and 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4) shall be held inoperative and without effect.\nSec. 5.  Additional Positions for Consideration.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director shall, after consultation with the Executive Office of the President, issue guidance about additional categories of positions that executive departments and agencies should consider recommending for Schedule Policy/Career.\nSec. 6.  Revocation.  Executive Order 14003 of January 22, 2021 (Protecting the Federal Workforce), is hereby revoked, and any rules, regulations, guidance, or other agency policies effectuated under Executive Order 14003 shall not be enforced.  The heads of each executive department and agency shall review and identify existing agency actions relating to or arising under section 3(e)(v) and 3(f) of Executive Order 14003 (relating to suspending, revising, or rescinding revisions to discipline and unacceptable performance policies) and, as soon as practicable, suspend, revise, or rescind such actions identified in the review.\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025.",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nAPPLICATION OF PROTECTING AMERICANS FROM FOREIGN ADVERSARY CONTROLLED APPLICATIONS ACT TO TIKTOK\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nAPPLICATION OF PROTECTING AMERICANS FROM FOREIGN ADVERSARY CONTROLLED APPLICATIONS ACT TO TIKTOK\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1.  Policy.  The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (the “Act”) (Pub. L. 118-50, div. H) regulates “foreign adversary controlled applications,” specifically those operated by TikTok and any other subsidiary of its China-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., on national security grounds.\nSection 2(a) of the Act prohibits entities from distributing, maintaining, or updating certain defined foreign adversary controlled applications within the territory of the United States by providing (A) services for such distribution, maintenance, or updates by means of an online mobile application store or other marketplace; or (B) internet hosting services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of such applications.  Section 2(g) of the Act defines “Foreign Adversary Controlled Application” to include websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, and augmented or immersive technology applications operated directly or indirectly by ByteDance Ltd. or TikTok.  Under section 2(a) of the Act, the prohibitions of the Act with respect to these entities became effective on January 19, 2025.\nI have the unique constitutional responsibility for the national security of the United States, the conduct of foreign policy, and other vital executive functions.  To fulfill those responsibilities, I intend to consult with my advisors, including the heads of relevant departments and agencies on the national security concerns posed by TikTok, and to pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans.  My Administration must also review sensitive intelligence related to those concerns and evaluate the sufficiency of mitigation measures TikTok has taken to date.\nThe unfortunate timing of section 2(a) of the Act — one day before I took office as the 47th President of the United States — interferes with my ability to assess the national security and foreign policy implications of the Act’s prohibitions before they take effect.  This timing also interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns.  Accordingly, I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans.\nSec. 2.  Action\n.\n(a)  I hereby order the Attorney General not to take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 75 days from the date of this order, to permit my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok.  During this period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution, maintenance, or updating) of any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act.  In light of this direction, even after the expiration of the above-specified period, the Department of Justice shall not take any action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period or any period prior to the issuance of this order, including the period of time from January 19, 2025, to the signing of this order.\n(b)  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to issue written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a).\n(c)  I further order the Attorney General to issue a letter to each provider stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period, as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act until the issuance of this Executive Order.\n(d)  Because of the national security interests at stake and because section 2(d) of the Act vests authority for investigations and enforcement of the Act only in the Attorney General, attempted enforcement by the States or private parties represents an encroachment on the powers of the Executive.  The Attorney General shall exercise all available authority to preserve and defend the Executive’s exclusive authority to enforce the Act.\nSec. 3.  General Provisions\n.\n(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025.",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nDelivering Emergency Price Relief for American Families and Defeating the Cost-of-Living Crisis\nJanuary 20, 2025\nOver the past 4 years, the Biden Administration’s destructive policies inflicted an historic inflation crisis on the American people.  The Biden Administration not only exploded Government spending, artificially and unsustainably stimulating demand, but it simultaneously made necessary goods and services scarce through a crushing regulatory burden and radical policies designed to weaken American production.  Hardworking families today are overwhelmed by the cost of fuel, food, housing, automobiles, medical care, utilities, and insurance.\nIn particular, the assault on plentiful and reliable American energy through unnecessary and illegal regulatory demands has driven up the cost of transportation and manufacturing.  In addition, the unlawful regulatory mandate on companies to effectively eliminate many or most gas-powered vehicles has resulted in artificial price increases on those popular vehicles to subsidize electric vehicles disfavored by consumers.\nMoreover, many Americans are unable to purchase homes due to historically high prices, in part due to regulatory requirements that alone account for 25 percent of the cost of constructing a new home according to recent analysis.\nIn sum, unprecedented regulatory oppression from the Biden Administration is estimated to have imposed almost $50,000 in costs on the average American household, whereas my first-term agenda reduced regulatory costs by almost $11,000 per household.  It is critical to restore purchasing power to the American family and improve our quality of life.\nI hereby order the heads of all executive departments and agencies to deliver emergency price relief, consistent with applicable law, to the American people and increase the prosperity of the American worker.  This shall include pursuing appropriate actions to:  lower the cost of housing and expand housing supply; eliminate unnecessary administrative expenses and rent-seeking practices that increase healthcare costs; eliminate counterproductive requirements that raise the costs of home appliances; create employment opportunities for American workers, including drawing discouraged workers into the labor force; and eliminate harmful, coercive “climate” policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.  Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy shall report to me and every 30 days thereafter, on the status of the implementation of this memorandum.",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nRegulatory Freeze Pending Review\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order all executive departments and agencies to take the following steps:\n(1)  Do not propose or issue any rule in any manner, including by sending a rule to the Office of the\nFederal Register\n(the “OFR”), until a department or agency head appointed or designated by the President after noon on January 20, 2025, reviews and approves the rule.  The department or agency head may delegate this power of review and approval to any other person so appointed or designated by the President, consistent with applicable law.  The Director or Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget (the “OMB Director”) may exempt any rule that he deems necessary to address emergency situations or other urgent circumstances, including rules subject to statutory or judicial deadlines that require prompt action.\n(2)  Immediately withdraw any rules that have been sent to the OFR but not published in the\nFederal Register\n, so that they can be reviewed and approved as described in paragraph 1, subject to the exceptions described in paragraph 1.\n(3)  Consistent with applicable law and subject to the exceptions described in paragraph 1, consider postponing for 60 days from the date of this memorandum the effective date for any rules that have been published in the\nFederal Register\n,\nor any rules that have been issued in any manner but have not taken effect, for the purpose of reviewing any questions of fact, law, and policy that the rules may raise.  During this 60-day period, where appropriate and consistent with applicable law, consider opening a comment period to allow interested parties to provide comments about issues of fact, law, and policy raised by the rules postponed under this memorandum, and consider reevaluating pending petitions involving such rules.  As appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and where necessary to continue to review these questions of fact, law, and policy, consider further delaying, or publishing for notice and comment, proposed rules further delaying such rules beyond the 60-day period.\n(4)  Following the postponement described in paragraph 3, no further action needs to be taken for those rules that raise no substantial questions of fact, law, or policy.  For those rules that raise substantial questions of fact, law, or policy, agencies should notify and take further appropriate action in consultation with the OMB Director.\n(5)  Comply in all circumstances with any applicable Executive Orders concerning regulatory management.\nAs used in this memorandum, “rule” has the definition set forth in section 551(4), title 5, United States Code.  It also includes any “regulatory action,” as defined in section 3(e) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, as amended, and any “guidance document” as defined in section 2(b) of Executive Order 13891 of October 9, 2019 (Promoting the Rule of Law Through Improved Agency Guidance Documents), when that order was in effect.  Thus, the requirements of this memorandum apply not only to “rules” as defined in section 551(4) of title 5, but also to any substantive action by an agency (normally published in the\nFederal Register\n) that promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking.  They shall also apply to any agency statement of general applicability and future effect that sets forth a policy on a statutory, regulatory, or technical issue or an interpretation of a statutory or regulatory issue.\nThe OMB Director shall oversee the implementation of this memorandum, and any communications regarding any matters pertaining to this review should be addressed to the OMB Director.  The OMB Director is also authorized to establish a process to review pending collections of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, as codified in chapter 35, title 44, United States Code, and to take actions that the OMB Director deems appropriate based on that review, consistent with applicable law.\nShould actions be identified that were undertaken before noon on January 20, 2025, that frustrate the purpose underlying this memorandum, I may modify or extend this memorandum, to require that department and agency heads consider taking steps to address those actions.\nThe OMB Director is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the\nFederal Register\n.\nThis memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nENDING THE WEAPONIZATION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1.  Purpose\n.\nThe American people have witnessed the previous administration engage in a systematic campaign against its perceived political opponents, weaponizing the legal force of numerous Federal law enforcement agencies and the Intelligence Community against those perceived political opponents in the form of investigations, prosecutions, civil enforcement actions, and other related actions.  These actions appear oriented more toward inflicting political pain than toward pursuing actual justice or legitimate governmental objectives.  Many of these activities appear to be inconsistent with the Constitution and/or the laws of the United States, including those activities directed at parents protesting at school board meetings, Americans who spoke out against the previous administration’s actions, and other Americans who were simply exercising constitutionally protected rights.\nThe prior administration and allies throughout the country engaged in an unprecedented, third-world weaponization of prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process.  It targeted individuals who voiced opposition to the prior administration’s policies with numerous Federal investigations and politically motivated funding revocations, which cost Americans access to needed services.  The Department of Justice even jailed an individual for posting a political meme.  And while the Department of Justice has ruthlessly prosecuted more than 1,500 individuals associated with January 6, and simultaneously dropped nearly all cases against BLM rioters.\nTherefore, this order sets forth a process to ensure accountability for the previous administration’s weaponization of the Federal Government against the American people.\nSec. 2.  Policy\n.\nIt is the policy of the United States to identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to the weaponization of law enforcement and the weaponization of the Intelligence Community.\nSec. 3.  Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government.  (a)  The Attorney General, in consultation with the heads of all departments and agencies of the United States, shall take appropriate action to review the activities of all departments and agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority of the United States, including, but not limited to, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission, over the last 4 years and identify any instances where a department’s or agency’s conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies of this order, and prepare a report to be submitted to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of this order.\n(b)  The Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the heads of the appropriate departments and agencies within the Intelligence Community, shall take all appropriate action to review the activities of the Intelligence Community over the last 4 years and identify any instances where the Intelligence Community’s conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies of this order, and prepare a report to be submitted to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the National Security Advisor, with recommendations for appropriate remedial actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of this order.  The term “Intelligence Community” has the meaning given the term in section 3003 of title 50, United States Code.\n(c)  In furtherance of these policies, departments and agencies are directed to comply with applicable document-retention policies and legal obligations.  Instances of noncompliance with document-retention policies or legal obligations will be referred to the Attorney General.\nSec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025.",

    "text": "Presidential Actions\nRESTORING FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ENDING FEDERAL CENSORSHIP\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\nJanuary 20, 2025\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1.  Purpose.\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution, an amendment essential to the success of our Republic, enshrines the right of the American people to speak freely in the public square without Government interference.  Over the last 4 years, the previous administration trampled free speech rights by censoring Americans’ speech on online platforms, often by exerting substantial coercive pressure on third parties, such as social media companies, to moderate, deplatform, or otherwise suppress speech that the Federal Government did not approve.  Under the guise of combatting “misinformation,” “disinformation,” and “malinformation,” the Federal Government infringed on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that advanced the Government’s preferred narrative about significant matters of public debate.  Government censorship of speech is intolerable in a free society.\nSec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to:       (a)  secure the right of the American people to engage in constitutionally protected speech;\n(b)  ensure that no Federal Government officer, employee, or agent engages in or facilitates any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen;\n(c)  ensure that no taxpayer resources are used to engage in or facilitate any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen; and\n(d)  identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech.\nSec. 3.  Ending Censorship of Protected Speech.  (a)  No Federal department, agency, entity, officer, employee, or agent may act or use any Federal resources in a manner contrary to section 2 of this order.\n(b)  The Attorney General, in consultation with the heads of executive departments and agencies, shall investigate the activities of the Federal Government over the last 4 years that are inconsistent with the purposes and policies of this order and prepare a report to be submitted to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, with recommendations for appropriate remedial actions to be taken based on the findings of the report.\nSec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)   the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025.",

the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1.  Purpose and Policy.  The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government.  The injection of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) into our institutions has corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy.  Orders to open the borders have endangered the American people and dissolved Federal, State, and local resources that should be used to benefit the American people.  Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation.\nTo commence the policies that will make our Nation united, fair, safe,

be the first of many steps the United States Federal Government will take to repair our institutions and our economy.\nSec. 2.  Revocation of Orders and Actions.  The following executive actions are

  "The Inaugural Address": {
    "text": "Remarks\nThe Inaugural Address\nJanuary 20, 2025\nU.S. Capitol\nWashington, D.C.\n12:10 P.M. EST\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much, everybody.  (Applause.)  Wow.  Thank you very, very much.\nVice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens, the golden age of America begins right now.  (Applause.)\nFrom this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.  We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.  During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.  (Applause.)\nOur sovereignty will be reclaimed.  Our safety will be restored.  The scales of justice will be rebalanced.  The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.  (Applause.)\nAnd our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free.  (Applause.)\nAmerica will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.  (Applause.)\nI return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success.  A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.\nBut first, we must be honest about the challenges we face.  While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.\nAs we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust.  For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.\nWe now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.\nIt fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.\nWe have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.\nOur country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina — who have been treated so badly — (applause) — and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense.  They’re raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country — some of whom are sitting here right now.  They don’t have a home any longer.  That’s interesting.  But we can’t let this happen.  Everyone is unable to do anything about it.  That’s going to change.\nWe have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.\nAnd we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves — in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them.  All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.  (Applause.)\nMy recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and, indeed, their freedom.  From this moment on, America’s decline is over.  (Applause.)\nOur liberties and our nation’s glorious destiny will no longer be denied.  And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America’s government.\nOver the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I’ve learned a lot along the way.\nThe journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one — that, I can tell you.  Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.\nJust a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin’s bullet ripped through my ear.  But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason.  I was saved by God to make America great again.  (Applause.)\nThank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nThank you very much.  (Applause.)\nThat is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength.  We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.\nFor American citizens, January 20th, 2025, is Liberation Day.  (Applause.)  It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.\nAs our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural.  And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states — (applause) — and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.  (Applause.)\nTo the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote.  We set records, and I will not forget it.  I’ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\nToday is Martin Luther King Day.  And his honor — this will be a great honor.  But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality.  We will make his dream come true.  (Applause.)\nThank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nNational unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before.  In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success.  We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God.  Can’t do that.  (Applause.)\nToday, I will sign a series of historic executive orders.  With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.  It’s all about common sense.  (Applause.)\nFirst, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border.  (Applause.)\nAll illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.  We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy.  (Applause.)\nI will end the practice of catch and release.  (Applause.)\nAnd I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.  (Applause.)\nUnder the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.  (Applause.)\nAnd by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.  (Applause.)\nAs commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do.  We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\nNext, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.  (Applause.)\nThe inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency.  We will drill, baby, drill.  (Applause.)\nAmerica will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have — the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth — and we are going to use it.  We’ll use it.  (Applause.)\nWe will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world.  (Applause.)\nWe will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\nWith my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers.  (Applause.)\nIn other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.\nWe will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago.  And thank you to the autoworkers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence.  We did tremendously with their vote.  (Applause.)\nI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families.  Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.  (Applause.)\nFor this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues.  It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources.\nThe American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.\nTo restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency.  (Applause.)\nAfter years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.  (Applause.)\nNever again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents — something I know something about.  (Laughter.)  We will not allow that to happen.  It will not happen again.\nUnder my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.  (Applause.)\nAnd we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.  (Applause.)\nThis week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.  (Applause.)  We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.  (Applause.)\nAs of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.  (Applause.)\nThis week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pay.  (Applause.)\nAnd I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty.  It’s going to end immediately.  (Applause.)  Our armed forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America’s enemies.  (Applause.)\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.  We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end — and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.  (Applause.)\nMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.  That’s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.\nI’m pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.  (Applause.)\nThank you.\nAmerica will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.\nA short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America — (applause) — and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.  (Applause.)\nPresident McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent — he was a natural businessman — and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United Spates — the United States — I mean, think of this — spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.\nWe have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama’s promise to us has been broken.\nThe purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.  American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form.  And that includes the United States Navy.\nAnd above all, China is operating the Panama Canal.  And we didn’t give it to China.  We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.  (Applause.)\nAbove all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history’s greatest civilization.\nSo, as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success.  We will not be deterred.  Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.\nThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation — one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.\nAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.  (Applause.)\nAmbition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other.  There’s no nation like our nation.\nAmericans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers.  The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts.  The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.\nOur American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth.  No one comes close.\nAmericans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness.  They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand.  If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\nMany people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback.  But as you see today, here I am.  The American people have spoken.  (Applause.)\nI stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do.  In America, the impossible is what we do best.  (Applause.)\nFrom New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\nThey were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.\nTogether, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.\nAfter all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history.  With your help, we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love — and we love it so much.\nWe are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.  So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.  We’re going to win like never before.  (Applause.)\nThank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nThank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nIn recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before.\nWe will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism.  Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.\nAmerica will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and goodwill.  We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before.\nWe will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail.  From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation.\nWe will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans.  The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.\nThank you.  God bless America.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nThank you.  (Applause.)\nEND  12:40 P.M.

  "President Trump’s America First Priorities": {
    "text": "Briefings & Statements\nPresident Trump’s America First Priorities\nJanuary 20, 2025\nMAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN\nPresident Trump will take bold action to secure our border and protect American communities.\nThis includes ending Biden’s catch-and-release policies, reinstating Remain in Mexico, building the wall, ending asylum for illegal border crossers, cracking down on criminal sanctuaries, and enhancing vetting and screening of aliens.\nPresident Trump’s deportation operation will address the record border crossings of criminal aliens under the prior administration.\nThe President is suspending refugee resettlement, after communities were forced to house large and unsustainable populations of migrants, straining community safety and resources.\nThe Armed Forces, including the National Guard, will engage in border security, which is national security, and will be deployed to the border to assist existing law enforcement personnel.\nPresident Trump will begin the process of designating cartels, including the dangerous Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist organizations and use the Alien Enemies Act to remove them.\nThe Department of Justice will seek the death penalty as the appropriate punishment for heinous crimes against humanity, including those who kill law enforcement officers and illegal migrants who maim and murder Americans.\nMAKE AMERICA AFFORDABLE AND ENERGY DOMINANT AGAIN\nThe President will unleash American energy by ending Biden’s policies of climate extremism, streamlining permitting, and reviewing for rescission all regulations that impose undue burdens on energy production and use, including mining and processing of non-fuel minerals.\nPresident Trump’s energy actions empower consumer choice in vehicles, showerheads, toilets, washing machines, lightbulbs and dishwashers.\nPresident Trump will declare an energy emergency and use all necessary resources to build critical infrastructure.\nPresident Trump’s energy policies will end leasing to massive wind farms that degrade our natural landscapes and fail to serve American energy consumers.\nPresident Trump will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.\nAll agencies will take emergency measures to reduce the cost of living.\nPresident Trump will announce the America First Trade Policy.\nAmerica will no longer be beholden to foreign organizations for our national tax policy, which punishes American businesses.\nDRAIN THE SWAMP\nThe President will usher a Golden Age for America by reforming and improving the government bureaucracy to work for the American people. He will freeze bureaucrat hiring except in essential areas to end the onslaught of useless and overpaid DEI activists buried into the federal workforce. He will pause burdensome and radical regulations not yet in effect that Biden announced.\nPresident Trump is announcing an unprecedented slate of executive orders for rescission.\nPresident Trump is planning for improved accountability of government bureaucrats. The American people deserve the highest-quality service from people who love our country. The President will also return federal workers to work, as only 6% of employees currently work in person.\nPresident Trump is taking swift action to end the weaponization of government against political rivals and ordering all document retention as required by law. President Trump is also ending the unconstitutional censorship by the federal government. No longer will government employees pick and require the erasure of entirely true speech.\nOn the President’s direction, the State Department will have an America-First foreign policy.\nBRING BACK AMERICAN VALUES\nThe President will establish male and female as biological reality and protect women from radical gender ideology.\nAmerican landmarks will be named to appropriately honor our Nation’s history.",
